      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p class="pub-abstract" itemprop="text">Our team organizes a workshop on « Software Engineering for Sustainability »together with Lancaster University. The workshop will last for 2 days. It willtake place in rooms Petri and Turing. Here is the program of the first day :Feb.28: 09:00 - 09:30: Welcome coffee09:30 - 10:30: TBA (from Lancaster)10:30 -11:00: coffee break11:00 - 12:00: Weighting observations and models to assessthe uncertain fate of nitrates in the environment (Jean-Raynald de Dreuzy,Géosciences Rennes, OSUR) * Increasing quantities of fertilizers delivered to   soils have deeply modified the cycle of some elements like nitrogen. This is   a complex societal and scientific issue difficult to handle because of the   high temporal and special variabilities and uncertainties on the natural   processes of transfer and degradation in the different hydrological   compartments. The rapid development of sensors is however modifying the   relation between data and models with new prediction opportunities. Classical   mechanistic models become increasingly limited as the sole intermediary   between data and predictions. The OSUR in Rennes (a federation of research   units on environmental sciences) coordinates a number of projects on this   type of question from field characterization to the development of innovative   modeling capacities. Central in our research strategy is the consolidation of   field observatories. Coupled virtual observatories have been proposed for   complementary analysis.12:00 - 14:00: lunch at IRISA14:00 - 14:30: Presentation of the DiverSE team,and perspectives (B. Baudry, Inria)14:30 - 15:00: Approximate computing (B.Baudry, Inria)15:00 - 15:30: Language-Oriented Modeling (B. Combemale, IRISA,UR1) * Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) encompasses the identification of added-value   domain knowledge, and Software Language Engineering (SLE) covers the   technical activities to turn such a domain knowledge into customized   Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs). However, the interplay between both is   still challenging: how to turn application-level and business knowledge into   added-value DSMLs? How to scale-up with their multiplication due to the   various stakeholders and application domains of interest? I will review a   decade of research activities dedicated to these questions. The challenge is   twofold: to capture domain-specific knowledge into added-value DSLs while   supporting their possible reuse and customization in other contexts; and to   support the separation of concerns through the use of multiple DSLs while   ensuring their automatic and correct integration.15:30 - 16:00: coffee break16:00 - 16:30: Automated Specialization ofConfigurable Systems (M. Acher, IRISA, UR1)16:30 - 17:00: Distributed adaptivesystems with Models@runtime using Kevoree (O. Barais, IRISA, UR1) * Modern   software applications are distributed and often operate in dynamic contexts,   where requirements, assumptions about the environment,and usage profiles   continuously change. These changes are difficult to predict and to anticipate   at design time. The running software system should thus be able to react on   its own, by dynamically adapting its behavior, in order to sustain a required   quality ofservice. A key challenge is to provide the system with the   necessary flexibility to perform self-adaptation, without compromising   dependability. Models@Runtime is a paradigm aiming at transferring   traditional modeling activities (focusing on quality, verification, and so   on) performed by humans, to the running system. In this trend, Kevoree   provides a models@runtime platform to design heterogeneous, distributed and   adaptive applications based on the component based software engineering   paradigm. Our goal on this talk is to discuss why models@runtime can help to   provide generic solution for bulding reconfigurable system.17:00 - 17:30: Building energy model to support efficient renewable-energymanagement (J. Bourcier, IRISA, UR1) * We lead different activities to provide   methodology to build consumption and production model using machine-nearning   techniques. Through the collaboration with 3 different partners, we explore   how we can provide efficient energy models.20:00-23:00: dinner (information to be added)</p>

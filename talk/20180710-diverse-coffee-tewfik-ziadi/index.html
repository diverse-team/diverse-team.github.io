      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p class="pub-abstract" itemprop="text">Tewfik Ziadi is visiting DiverSE for a few days. This is the opportunity for theteam to learn more about Software Product Lines !AbstractSoftware Product Lines(SPLs) represent one of the most exciting paradigm shift in software developmentin the two last decades. However, adopting an SPL approach and designing SPLvariability is still a major challenge and represents a risk for a company.First, compared to single-system development, SPL variability management impliesa methodology that highly impacts the life cycle of the products as well as theprocesses and roles inside the company. Second, adopting an SPL from thebeginning, called proactive SPL adoption is subject to two main assumptions: 1)the company must have, in advance, a complete understanding of the variabilityto anticipate all possible variations; 2) the company should start from scratchto specify the variability and implement the reusable assets.Recent studies with industrial companies that participated in industrial SPLengineering showed that around 50% of them cannot adopt SPL proactively. On theone hand, the variability in these companies is discovered as customer needsemerge over time; so, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to anticipate allthe variations from the beginning. On the other hand, companies already haveexisting product variants that were implemented using an opportunistic reuse inan ad-hoc way to quickly respond to different customer needs. Instead ofadopting an SPL, many companies clone an existing product and modify it to fitthe new customer needs. This approach, called clone-and-own, is widely usedbecause it is faster and more efficient to start with an already developed andtested set of artifacts. Companies thus face the SPL adoption dilemma: they areaware that SPL can enable them to achieve large-scale productivity gains,improve time-to-market and product quality. However, these same companiesalready have existing variants created using the clone-and-own approach.Consequently, they are practically unable to adopt SPL.This talk presents our contributions in what is referred to as extractive SPLadoption. The objective was to propose approaches to migrate existing similarproduct variants, created using the clone-and-own approach, into an SPL. Insteadof designing variability, our work focused on variability inference. The firstpart of our work considered static variability inference, which is based on theanalysis of the structural (or static) information of the product variants,including, for instance, the source code, models, requirements, documentationetc. In addition to the structural information, product variants can also bedefined by the dynamic information on their execution. The execution traces arethe main source of such information. When execution traces are available, it ispossible to analyze them to infer the behavior of these product variants, whichcan be used to infer the SPL behavior. The second part of our work is thusrelated to dynamic variability inference, which refers to variability inferenceusing the dynamic information. Our contributions were implemented and integratedwithin the BUT4Reuse tool.

# 🎯 Join a Cutting-Edge Cybersecurity Research Project

Are you passionate about **cybersecurity**, **software/system architecture**, and **model-based techniques**? We're looking for a talented PhD candidate to tackle one of the most pressing challenges in modern system security: evaluating and promoting compartmentalization in embedded systems.

---

## 🔬 The Research Challenge

In an era where cyber threats are increasingly sophisticated, **compartmentalization** represents a critical last line of defense against attacks. Despite its proven effectiveness, compartmentalization remains underutilized in embedded system design. Why? Current threat modeling tools simply aren't equipped to properly evaluate compartmentalized architectures.

Your mission: **Change this.**

> *"Despite longstanding recognition within the academic sphere and proven effectiveness in seminal industry projects, the adoption of compartmentalization techniques in main-stream software remains inconsistent: compartmentalizing is still far from being a common engineering practice."*  
> — Lefeuvre et al. [Lef+25]

## 🚀 Your Project at a Glance

You'll develop a **tool-supported methodology** that revolutionizes how we threat model compartmentalized embedded systems. This involves:

### Core Innovations

**1. Comprehensive Ontology Development**  
Create a formal ontology capturing the features and characteristics of various compartmentalization techniques — from virtualization to process isolation.

**2. Specialized Modeling Language**  
Design an Architecture Description Language with rich semantics specifically tailored for compartmentalized systems.

**3. Semi-Automated Threat Analysis**  
Build intelligent algorithms that, compared to existing tools, better take into account compartmentalization in the assessment of embedded systems architectures.

**4. Real-World Validation**  
Evaluate your methodology on well-known compartmentalized systems (Qmail, Postfix, OpenSSH) and potentially on security-critical systems from the **US Naval Research Laboratory**.

## 💡 What Makes This Position Unique

### **High-Impact Research Domain**
As international regulations increasingly mandate threat modeling, your work will address a **real and urgent need** in the cybersecurity industry. System providers worldwide need better tools to demonstrate their products' cyber resilience.

### **Strong Connections**
- Collaborate directly with the **French Defense Procurement Agency ([DGA](https://www.defense.gouv.fr/dga))**
- Potential partnerships with international partners of the DiverSE team
- Evaluation on architectural models of real-world security-sensitive systems

### **Cutting-Edge Technical Stack**
Work at the intersection of:
- **(Model-Based) System Engineering** — (embedded) system architecture, modeling languages, domain-specific languages
- **Cybersecurity** — threat modeling, compartmentalization, security evaluation
- **Semi-Formal Methods** — ontologies, semantics, automated reasoning

### **Publication Opportunities**
Position yourself at the forefront of an emerging research area with excellent potential for high-quality publications at top-tier conferences.

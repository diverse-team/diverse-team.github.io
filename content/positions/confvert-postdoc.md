# Postdoctoral Position "CONFVERT: Green Software Configurations"

The postdoctoral candidate must have spent at least 18 months abroad (outside France) between May 1, 2021, and the project start.

Availability: ready to start 02 January 2026 — application submitted now.

## Scientific and Technical Context

Modern software is highly configurable; interactions between options and their execution environments (hardware, OS, versions, inputs, build/test pipelines) strongly affect both energy use and performance. 
CONFVERT targets “green” configurations-settings that minimize energy while preserving acceptable performance—by explicitly modeling and learning from this deep variability, with open data, open tools, and reproducible methods on widely used open‑source stacks.

## Tasks and Responsibilities (high level)

Lead research to (i) model configuration–energy trade‑offs, (ii) design robust, generalizable predictive/optimization approaches, (iii) run reproducible empirical studies on representative systems, and (iv) translate results into actionable recommendations, datasets, and open‑source tooling for researchers and practitioners. 

## Environment context

The postdoc will join DiverSE (IRISA/Inria & University of Rennes) in Rennes, supervised by Prof. Mathieu Acher and Quentin Perez -- a recognized software‑engineering team with strong expertise in variability, configurable systems, energy‑aware evaluation, and open science, offering an ideal setting for impactful research and community transfer.
The postdoctoral candidate must have spent at least 18 months abroad (outside France) between May 1, 2021, and the project start.

CONVERT is supported by Britany region.

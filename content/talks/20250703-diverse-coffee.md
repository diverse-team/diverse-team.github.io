title: "SAUsmart - Prediction for emergency departments"
abstract: >
  Emergency departments are tense and pressured places: unforeseen events and saturated services punctuate the days of caregivers. SAUsmart is a tool to help the organization of the emergency department based on machine learning models.
  It allows you to make various forecasts:
  - the number of admissions in a given emergency department.
  - for each patient in the department, whether they will be hospitalized or not.
  This conference will present the methods and techniques used, and highlight an example of AI application in the field of health in order to improve the working conditions of hospital staff.

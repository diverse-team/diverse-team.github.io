title: "Hideous memory leaks and where to find them (and sometimes fix them)"
abstract: >
  Memory is a limited resource for a long running service. Even the slightest leak can crash or harm the performance of services that must run for days, weeks or even months.
  In this talk, we will discuss the source of actual memory leaks we found when developing micro-services at MediaKind and the tools we can use to find them.
  At the end we will present some related problems and research questions that might be interesting to solve and answer.

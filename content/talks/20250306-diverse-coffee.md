title: "The Search for the GREAL"
abstract: >
    The research community has achieved a great success in the standardization of the Universal Variability Language (UVL), a language for defining, creating, and managing variations in products and services.
    However UVL only partially fulfills the vision of orthogonal variability engineering. Missing is how the variability is realized with respect to the assets of a product line.
    In this talk, we investigate how the core principle that led to the UVL success could be applied to come up with the GREAL: a Generic REAlization Language.
    We identify openness, flexibility, declarativity and reusability as key aspects for managing realization of variability across industries, as well as using a layered approach to progressively fit more demanding contexts.

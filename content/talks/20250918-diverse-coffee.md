title: "Web browser fingerprint similarity"
abstract: >
  During this presentation, I will introduce myself and talk about my work over the past two months. My goal was to measure the distances between web browser fingerprints in order to reveal clusters of users. This may lead to better ways to protect users' privacy online in the future. This work involves several methods, such as feature models and machine learning.

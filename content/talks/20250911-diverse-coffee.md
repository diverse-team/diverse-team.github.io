title: "The Infer static analysis platform"
abstract: >
  I will present the project on which I’ve been working on for four years now at Meta. This static analysis platform is a true example of research innovation transferred to industry more than 10 years ago by Peter O’Hearn and his colleagues. I will explain how the tool is used nowadays, and some specific work I’ve done there.

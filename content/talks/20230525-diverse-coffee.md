title: "Fingerprinting and Building Large Reproducible Datasets"
abstract: >
  Obtaining a relevant dataset is central to conducting empirical studies in
  software engineering. However, in the context of mining software
  repositories, the lack of appropriate tooling for large scale mining tasks
  hinders the creation of new datasets. Moreover, limitations related to data
  sources that change over time (e.g., code bases) and the lack of
  documentation of extraction processes make it difficult to reproduce datasets
  over time. This threatens the quality and reproducibility of empirical
  studies. In this paper, we propose a tool-supported approach facilitating the
  creation of large tailored datasets while ensuring their reproducibility. We
  leveraged all the sources feeding the Software Heritage append-only archive
  which are accessible through a unified programming interface to outline a
  reproducible and generic extraction process. We propose a way to define a
  unique fingerprint to characterize a dataset which, when provided to the
  extraction process, ensures that the same dataset will be extracted. We
  demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by implementing a prototype. We
  show how it can help reduce the limitations researchers face when creating or
  reproducing datasets.

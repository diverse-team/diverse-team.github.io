title: "Sirius Web: A Low Code Language Workbench to Create Graphical Modeling Environment"
abstract: >
  
  Eclipse Sirius is an open source project dedicated to the design and utilization of graphical modeling languages with a low code approach. This project started in 2007 in collaboration with Thales through the first implementation Eclipse Sirius Desktop, an Eclipse-based language workbench. For a decade, Sirius Desktop has been used for numerous desktop projects but these required installation on the users’ machines. To simplify the deployment phase, we proposed in 2019 the first release of a new cloud-native implementation of Sirius named Eclipse Sirius Web, based on the same principles of Sirius Desktop and refined with our experience. In this talk, we will look at the main principles of the Sirius project before focusing on Sirius Web. We will finish with a demo of Sirius Web where we will implement in an iterative way a small DSL with both diagram and form representation.

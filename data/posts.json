Avoir des outils qui analysent automatiquement ce que l'on écrit pour y trouver des problèmes et éventuellement les corriger, c'est mieux. Est-il nécessaire de rappeler qu'un langage tout seul ne sert à rien \ns'il n'est pas accompagné d'un écosystème composé d'outils visant à \nfaciliter la vie des développeurs utilisant ledit langage ?<br />\nDe la même manière, faire évoluer  du code est un processus crucial dans la vie d'un logiciel, mais coûteux si réalisé manuellement : au hasard des récentes sorties, n'avez jamais pensé à faire migrer une suite de tests JUnit4 vers JUnit5 mais abandonné devant la charge de travail que cela supposerait ? Et si un outil le faisait pour vous ?<br />\n<br />\nLa réalisation de telles opérations requière des analyseurs de code. On parle : d'analyse statique lorsque le code est analysé sans être exécuté (par exemple, identifier les classes dont le nom ne respecte pas les conventions de nommage Java) ; d'analyse dynamique lorsque le code est analysé pendant son exécution (par exemple, mesurer la couverture de code consiste à analyser pendant son exécution les instructions couvertes par des tests). On s'intéresse ici à l'analyse statique.<br />\nLes analyseurs de code commencent par transformer en mémoire le texte du code en un arbre syntaxique abstrait (AST -- <i>Abstract Syntax Tree</i>) répresentant la structure du code pour faciliter son étude. Ils parcourent ensuite cet AST pour réaliser des analyses et transformations.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://github.com/INRIA/spoon\">Spoon</a> est une librairie open-source Java permettant d'analyser et de transformer du code Java.\nCe billet vise à introduire l'écriture d'analyseurs statiques et de transformateurs de code avec Spoon et au travers de quelques cas d'usage, en l’occurrence : détecter des potentiels problèmes dans du code Java ; ré-usiner (\"<i>refactorer</i>\") du code Java pour enlever ces problèmes.<br />\n<br />\nSpoon est, entre autres, disponible sur le dépôt Maven Central ce qui permet de l'importer facilement dans un projet Maven : <br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"gistLoad\" data-id=\"044339e41889ef7b98250b88a4d147f6\" id=\"gist-044339e41889ef7b98250b88a4d147f6\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nChargement ....</div>\n<h3>\nÉcrire un premier analyseur de code : détecter des tests JUnit non annotés avec @Test</h3>\nLe premier analyseur que nous allons développer permettra de détecter les tests JUnit qui ne sont pas annotés avec l'annotation <span style=\"font-family: &quot;courier new&quot; , &quot;courier&quot; , monospace;\">@Test</span>. <br />\nPour commencer, il est nécessaire d'écrire un processeur qui va s'intéresser à un type d'élements de l'AST ; dans notre cas il s'agit des méthodes (<span style=\"font-family: &quot;courier new&quot; , &quot;courier&quot; , monospace;\">CtMethod</span> en Spoon).

GUIs <a href=\"https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01114724v2/document\">can be affected by various defects</a> such a widget not located at the expected position, a user interaction not working as expected, a widget not rendered as expected. Checking a GUI for such defects may thus involve different techniques: comparing screenshots to assess the rendering; checking some widgets' attributes; etc.<br />\nIn this blog post, I will show how to test a basic GUI with <a href=\"https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX\">TestFX, a (very nice) GUI testing framework for JavaFX</a>. The application I will test is a very simple one that just uses several widgets to select a colour. The GUI of this application looks like that:<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg4cXkj5NzDzgjsJNBcr77-DEjQ0GNsXfurioTgAkvmhW_nZmESShz3o1WwnqG4wkPxOL1SYE3VwNlttBbJLTgYzA6f7ToTsbkIr8fY7MiMOP7TOMr35Q__xF_9Oy3yTT_WhLJAmMKod6wX/s1600/Capture+du+2015-11-27+13-19-36.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg4cXkj5NzDzgjsJNBcr77-DEjQ0GNsXfurioTgAkvmhW_nZmESShz3o1WwnqG4wkPxOL1SYE3VwNlttBbJLTgYzA6f7ToTsbkIr8fY7MiMOP7TOMr35Q__xF_9Oy3yTT_WhLJAmMKod6wX/s1600/Capture+du+2015-11-27+13-19-36.png\" /></a></div>\nAll the widgets of this GUI are linked each other to handle the same colour. The spinner modifies the opacity of the picked colour. The background of the text field is the picked colour. This text field displays the hexa code of the colour. This text field is editable to select another colour (that changes the colour of the picker).</div>\n<div class=\"copyright\">\n<h3>\nConfiguring TestFX</h3>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nThe <a href=\"https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX/blob/master/README.md#gradle-and-maven\">readme file</a> of TestFX explains how to use it. I will use <a href=\"https://maven.apache.org/\">Maven</a> to add a dependency to TestFX and to get its jar files:</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"gistLoad\" data-id=\"ea104b2ac0ff5d051f23\" id=\"gist-ea104b2ac0ff5d051f23\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nLoading ....</div>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nWriting a TestFX test class</h3>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nTestFX works with <a href=\"http://junit.org/\">JUnit</a>. A TestFX test class must extend the TestFX class <i>ApplicationTest</i>. This requires the implementation of the <i>start</i> operation that has to load  the FXML document under test:</div>\n<div class=\"gistLoad\" data-id=\"d699d8e5fb64ec170f44\" id=\"gist-d699d8e5fb64ec170f44\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nLoading ....</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nA possible strategy to test a GUI consists of testing each FXML document separately. This may require the use of mocking features to isolate an FXML document and its controller from the other ones. I will write a blog post on that soon. For the moment, a single FXML document, <i>TestSimpleController</i>, is used, so that a single test class will be defined.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nThe <i>tearDown</i> operation is used here to clear all the possible key or mouse events that are still in progress at the end of each unit test. The <i>hideStage</i> operation closes the GUI after each test.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nThe <i>setUp</i> operation retrieves the widgets of the FXML document that will be used in the tests. I guess this step can be done in the <i>start</i> operation instead of using the <i>setUp</i> one. The <i>find</i> operation is just a shortcut to retrieve widgets.

There are several ways to simulate a user that selects a colour. A user can click on the colour button and then pick a colour using either the mouse (by clicking on a colour of the palette) or the keyboard (by typing on the \"tab\" key to put the focus on the colour of the palette to select to then type on \"enter\").</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nThe following <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trait_%28computer_programming%29\">trait</a> defines a robot that can interact with a colour picker to select a colour. This trait is in fact a Java interface composed of one <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/defaultmethods.html\">default method</a>. The Java 8 concept of default method permits the definition of traits, <i>i.e.</i> <a href=\"http://digitalcommons.ohsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1344&amp;context=csetech\">a composable (with other traits or classes) unit of behaviour that does not define any <span class=\"highlight selected\">state</span> variable</a>. One may note that the <a href=\"http://docs.scala-lang.org/tutorials/tour/traits.html\">Scala trait</a> goes beyond this  definition since it can have state variables (<i>i.e.</i> attributes).</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nTestFX and JUnit define their assertion and robot operations as static ones in some classes. I do not like <i>static</i> since it is not an object-oriented programming (OOP) concept. Instead, I prefer to define a trait that can be composed within  classes. It is fully OOP and avoids the annoying use of \"import static\".</div>\n<div class=\"gistLoad\" data-id=\"e213697ae53153fddeba\" id=\"gist-e213697ae53153fddeba\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nLoading ....</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nTo reuse the robot operations provided by TestFX, this <i>FxRobotColourPicker</i> trait extends the TestFX <i>FxRobotInterface</i> interface (yes, putting \"interface\" in the name of an interface is a bad coding practice). The <span class=\"pl-en\"><i>pickColour</i> operation just clicks on the colour picker's button to show the colour palette. Then, the \"tab\" and \"enter\" keys are used to select a colour.

To do so, we just have to simulate a user interaction with the text field using the <i>type</i> operation, as illustrated as follows:</div>\n<div class=\"gistLoad\" data-id=\"3e22b20bfba1c3d6b4dd\" id=\"gist-3e22b20bfba1c3d6b4dd\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nLoading ....</div>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nTesting a spinner</h4>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nJavaFX recently implemented the <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Spinner.html\">spinner</a> widget. The spinner of this application just permits the editing of the opacity of the selected colour. TestFX does not support its testing yet. So, similarly to the colour picker we can define a trait to simulate the use of a spinner:</div>\n<div class=\"gistLoad\" data-id=\"064b1fcefbb94234f29b\" id=\"gist-064b1fcefbb94234f29b\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nLoading ....</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nUnfortunately, I did not find any way to click on the increment or decrement buttons of the spinner. So, I withdrawn to a another solution: changing the value of the spinner using its value factory. Again, this solution is not perfect. If you have better ones, please detail them in the comments.\nWe can now use this trait and write a test that uses the spinner:\n</div>\n<div class=\"gistLoad\" data-id=\"4ee152e26f24b7c546da\" id=\"gist-4ee152e26f24b7c546da\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nLoading ....</div>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nTesting a combo box</h4>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nSame thing for the combo box.

This practice follows the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns\" target=\"_blank\">separation of concerns principle</a> promoting that a complex piece of software should be divided in several (as small as possible) software artefacts. This division must not be randomly performed. It must make sense by grouping, encapsulating in these software artefacts related elements and their services. That is why the term 'concern' is used, to talk about related elements.<br />\n<br />\nApplied to FXML documents, the separation of concerns principle consists of encapsulating in an FXML document a group of related widgets. This task is not trivial: What does 'related' mean for widgets? How to state which widgets are related each other? What about core widgets? <i>etc</i>. I usually group widgets by thinking about the different tasks these widgets have to do. <a href=\"https://github.com/arnobl/latexdraw/tree/master/latexdraw-core/net.sf.latexdraw/src/main/net/sf/latexdraw/view/jfx/ui\" target=\"_blank\">For instance with a drawing editor</a>, you will have for sure widgets dedicated to the creation of shapes, others to the deletion of shapes, others to the editing of the shape's properties (<i>e.g.</i> colour), <i>etc</i>.<br />\nI will illustrate this post with a mere JavaFX application, which views are defined as follows:<br />\n<div class=\"gistLoad\" data-id=\"53347fc9a6cf985dcc76\" id=\"gist-53347fc9a6cf985dcc76\">\nLoading ....</div>\nThis main view refers to the following FXML documents:\n<br />\n<div class=\"gistLoad\" data-id=\"3447d62782a19c9633dd\" id=\"gist-3447d62782a19c9633dd\">\nLoading ....</div>\n<div class=\"gistLoad\" data-id=\"64e18f27241fe4ebf7dc\" id=\"gist-64e18f27241fe4ebf7dc\">\nLoading ....</div>\nThe pros of this practice are multiple, in particular:<br />\n<ul>\n<li>You avoid the definition of a Blob view (by reference to the <a href=\"https://sourcemaking.com/antipatterns/the-blob\" target=\"_blank\">Blob class</a>), a large view that knows and does too much.

So, we would like to have an attribute in the <i>TextController</i> class to access the <i>PickerController</i> instance and its colour picker widgets.&nbsp;</span></span><br />\n<span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">The problem is that in JavaFX you can hardly manage the instantiation of the controllers. By default, the controller of a view is automatically instantiated (using its free-parameter constructor) during the loading of the view (in the case the FXML attribute <i>controller</i> is specified). In this case, you can hardly pass a <i>PickerController</i> instance as a parameter to the constructor of <i>TextController</i>. Various complex or bad solutions exist. For instance, the use of a setter to give a <i>PickerController</i> instance to <i>TextController</i> is not a good idea since it implies that <i>TextController</i> may not always have an instance of <i>PickerController</i>. You can also <a href=\"https://community.oracle.com/thread/2529134?start=0&amp;tstart=0\" target=\"_blank\">customise the factory that creates the controllers</a>. <b>In this post, we will see how to use dependency injection to simply define dependencies between controllers and, by extension, how such injections can be used to access special widgets defined in the view.</b></span></span><br />\n<br />\nSeveral frameworks support dependency injection, such as <a href=\"http://projects.spring.io/spring-framework/\" target=\"_blank\">Spring</a> and the JavaFX framework <a href=\"http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/javafx-productivity-2345000.html\" target=\"_blank\">Afterburns</a>.

We now want to inject into the class attribute <i>picker</i> <b>the</b> instance of <i>PickerController</i> created by JavaFX.<br />\n<br />\nTo do so, a special factory has to be provided to the FXML loader. This factory will be managed by Guice and will create the controllers. Before creating this factory, a Guice module has to be defined:<br />\n<div class=\"gistLoad\" data-id=\"ae3f7c826883b6801083\" id=\"gist-ae3f7c826883b6801083\">\nLoading ....</div>\nThe goal of such a Guice module is to configure (in the <i>configure</i> operation, of course) the injections. There is another way to configure injections: using annotations. We will use this feature as explained later. For the moment this module has to be used by the <i>FXMLLoader</i> to load the view:\n<br />\n<div class=\"gistLoad\" data-id=\"060b2c82e49586093b09\" id=\"gist-060b2c82e49586093b09\">\nLoading ....</div>\nLine 9, a Guice injector is created using the module we defined. Then, line 10, a factory that manages the instantiation of the controllers is defined. This last works simply: the class given as a parameter to the controller factory is sent to the Guice injector, that manages the controller instances, that finally returns an instance of the class.<br />\n<br />\nThere is still something missing in the code. In the <i>TextController</i> class, we must say to Guice that the class attribute <i>picker</i> must be injected. To do so, this class attribute has to be supplemented with the Guice annotation <i>@Inject</i>, as depicted as follows:\n<br />\n<div class=\"gistLoad\" data-id=\"fc638c729f8921fffd4c\" id=\"gist-fc638c729f8921fffd4c\">\nLoading ....</div>\nWhen we execute the application, we obtain the following log:<br />\n<span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: &quot;courier new&quot; , &quot;courier&quot; , monospace;\">Creating a PickerController: torgen.controller.PickerController@3fdfb3cd<br />TextField[id=text1, styleClass=text-input text-field]<br />TextField[id=text2, styleClass=text-input text-field]<br />Injected controller: torgen.controller.PickerController@3fdfb3cd<br />PickerController widgets: null null<br />Creating a PickerController: torgen.controller.PickerController@353c7717</span></span> <br />\n<br />\nThis log points out two problems. The first one is that two instances of <i>PickerController</i> are created: <i>PickerController@3fdfb3cd</i> during the loading of <i>PickerView.fxml</i> and <i>PickerController@3fdfb3cd</i> during the injection of <i>picker</i>. We want the same instance in these two places. A simple solution with controllers is to define them as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern\" target=\"_blank\">singletons</a>. This is quite logical: in most of the cases a controller class has to be instantiated a single time since it controls a unique view (if your controller cannot be a singleton, you can still customise the Guice module to do the job). Guice permits that by tagging a class controlled by Guice with the annotation <i>@Singleton</i>: \n<br />\n<div class=\"gistLoad\" data-id=\"20ecafd730b4634947ce\" id=\"gist-20ecafd730b4634947ce\">\nLoading ....</div>\nWe now obtain the following log:\n\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-family: &quot;courier new&quot; , &quot;courier&quot; , monospace;\">Creating a PickerController: torgen.controller.PickerController@cb74462<br />TextField[id=text1, styleClass=text-input text-field]<br />TextField[id=text2, styleClass=text-input text-field]<br />Injected controller: torgen.controller.PickerController@cb74462<br />PickerController widgets: null null</span><br />\n<br />\nOnly one instance of <i>PickerController</i> is now created.

So, it asks the <i>GuiceModule</i> for an instance <i>t</i> of <i>TextController</i>. <i>TextController</i> has an injected class attribute <i>picker</i>, which type is <i>PickerController</i>. So the <i>GuiceModule</i> creates an instance <i>p</i> of this class and inject it into <i>t</i>. One may note that <i>p</i> has not been loaded or initialised by the <i>FXMLLoader</i>. So, when the <i>FXMLLoader</i> calls the operation <i>initialize</i> on <i>t</i>, the colour pickers of <i>p</i> are <i>null</i>. Once <i>t</i> initialised, the <i>FXMLLoader</i> loads <i>PickerView.fxml</i> and asks the <i>GuiceModule</i> for an instance of <i>PickerController</i>. The instance <i>p</i> is returned to be then initialised. The colour pickers of <i>p</i> are then no more <i>null</i>. A bad hack to avoid this problem consists of  modifying <i>UI.fxml</i> to load <i>PickerView.fxml</i> before <i>TextView.fxml</i>. A better solution exists.<br />\n<br />\nA simple solution consists of initialising the controllers <b>once all  of them</b> have been created and injected. If this solution is theoretically simple, this is not the case in practice since JavaFX does not provide developers with such a feature. We have to develop it...<br />\n<br />\nFirst, similarly to the JavaFX interface <i>Initializable</i> (used to call the operation <i>initialize</i> just after the creation of one controller), we define an interface <i>Configurable</i> as follows:\n<br />\n<div class=\"gistLoad\" data-id=\"349c6732d7bcbfb04641\" id=\"gist-349c6732d7bcbfb04641\">\nLoading ....</div>\nThe controllers will have to implement this interface. The <i>configure</i> operation will be called once all the controllers have been created and injected. For instance with <i>TextController</i>:\n<br />\n<div class=\"gistLoad\" data-id=\"14068f0248e4da75cdb3\" id=\"gist-14068f0248e4da75cdb3\">\nLoading ....</div>\nIn this <i>configure</i> operation, the different data bindings can be established. The <i>FXMLLoader</i> must now call the <i>configure</i> operations. This is not possible with the standard <i>FXMLLoader</i> class. We thus define a dedicated class <i>FXMLControllersLoader</i>:\n<br />\n<div class=\"gistLoad\" data-id=\"8e17f6bad0eb91777636\" id=\"gist-8e17f6bad0eb91777636\">\nLoading ....</div>\n<i>FXMLControllersLoader</i> inherits of <i>FXMLLoader</i>. Line 2 is defined the set <i>controllers</i> that will contain all the created controllers. Line 10, the controller factory is customised: when an instance of a controller is returned by Guice, it is stored in <i>controllers</i>. Then, line 19, the <i>load</i> operation is overridden to call the <i>configure</i> operations on the created controllers.<br />\nThe use of this customised <i>FXMLLoader</i> requires some modifications in the main class:\n<br />\n<div class=\"gistLoad\" data-id=\"78ad1edc5f78e9f9d248\" id=\"gist-78ad1edc5f78e9f9d248\">\nLoading ....</div>\nThe log is now:<br />\n<span style=\"font-family: &quot;courier new&quot; , &quot;courier&quot; , monospace;\">Creating a PickerController: torgen.controller.PickerController@1a57655a<br />TextField[id=text1, styleClass=text-input text-field]<br />TextField[id=text2, styleClass=text-input text-field]<br />Injected controller: torgen.controller.PickerController@1a57655a<br />PickerController widgets: null null<br />DrawingArea created: DrawingArea@138d4915<br />PickerController widgets in configure: ColorPicker[id=picker1, styleClass=combo-box-base color-picker] ColorPicker[id=picker2, styleClass=combo-box-base color-picker]</span> <br />\nThat's it.

This is also possible with Guice.<br />\nThis customised widget is a drawing area that just display two shapes coloured by the selected colours.

If it is not the case in your application, you can still customise the Guice module or a factory. We add this widget in <i>UI.fxml</i>:\n<br />\n<div class=\"gistLoad\" data-id=\"0b78edb19d7227208b23\" id=\"gist-0b78edb19d7227208b23\">\nLoading ....</div>\nGuice must now manage the instantiation of the views (as it already manages the instantiation of the controllers). The <i>JavaFXBuilderFactory</i> provided to the <i>FXMLLoader</i> is replaced by a special one, defined as follows:\n<br />\n<div class=\"gistLoad\" data-id=\"530a56e3cb9d44730f96\" id=\"gist-530a56e3cb9d44730f96\">\nLoading ....</div>\nIn this class, the Guice injector is provided as a parameter of the constructor (line 6). A standard JavaFX view factory is created (line 9). The <i>getBuilder</i> operation is overridden (line 13). The goal of this operation is to return a builder corresponding to the view element (the widget) to instantiate. When a builder for the <i>DrawingArea</i> class is asked, the Guice injector is used to return the singleton (line 15). Otherwise, the standard JavaFX factory is used (line 16).

This practice follows the separation of concerns principle promoting that a complex piece of software should be divided in several (as small as possible) software artefacts. This division must not be randomly performed. It must make sense by grouping, encapsulating in these software artefacts related elements and their services. That is why the term 'concern' is used, to talk about related elements.\netc. I usually group widgets by thinking about the different tasks these widgets have to do. For instance with a drawing editor, you will have for sure widgets dedicated to the creation of shapes, others to the deletion of shapes, others to the editing of the shape's properties (e.g. colour), etc.\nYou avoid the definition of a Blob view (by reference to the Blob class), a large view that knows and does too much. Blob views may have a negative impact on the maintenance and the comprehension of the view.\nYou will be able to define multiple controllers, i.e. one controller per view (that, by extension of the previous item, avoids the definition of a Blob controller). Indeed, in JavaFX an FXML document can only have a single controller.\nTextView contains two text fields that just have to show the colour codes selected by the two colour pickers defined in PickerView.\nTextView's controller, TextController, depends on the PickerView's controller, PickerController, to access the colour pickers. So, we would like to have an attribute in the TextController class to access the PickerController instance and its colour picker widgets. \nThe problem is that in JavaFX you can hardly manage the instantiation of the controllers.

Historically, o3-mini, an ancestor of o3, has been released beginning of january 2025 to all ChatGPT users (including free-tier) and some API users. \nOn April 16, 2025, OpenAI released o3, a successor of o3-mini, and o4-mini (a “light” reasoning model).</p>\n\n<p>In the past, I have tried with GPT-2 https://blog.mathieuacher.com/GTP2AndChess/ (in 2020), different variants of GPT3 and 4 (especially the famous gpt3.5-turbo-instruct) https://blog.mathieuacher.com/GPTsChessEloRatingLegalMoves/ https://blog.mathieuacher.com/ChessWinning7MovesGPT-copy/ and recently DeepSeek-R1 https://blog.mathieuacher.com/DeepSeekR1WorstThanGPT2InChess-copy/. \nI have combined mixed-methods: either exploratory with qualitative analysis (I’m 2341 FIDE Elo rating and I can review/judge games), or with rigorous, in-depth quantitative analysis of, e.g., prompts’ variations sensitivity.</p>\n\n<p>So why not trying with this new family of models from OpenAI? \nIt’s interesting to test o3 or o4-mini, as some people claim or tend to think they are good at chess, can play legal moves, or that o3 is better than gpt3.5 (says).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"playing-chess-with-o-series\">Playing chess with o-series</h2>\n\n<p>I have started playing chess with o3 on https://www.chatgpt.com.\nI haven’t tried hard on prompting, and I’ve been playing with the default settings. \nIn particular, you cannot control the reasoning effort (see hereafter).</p>\n\n<p>Let’s review a game.</p>\n\n<p>I made my special: playing with black and hopefully winning in 4 moves.\nI have already tried https://blog.mathieuacher.com/ChessWinning7MovesGPT-copy/ on other versions/variants of GPT. \nI have also tried with DeepSeek-R1 https://blog.mathieuacher.com/DeepSeekR1WorstThanGPT2InChess/.</p>\n\n<p>The principle is to use this unusual sequence of moves\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">1. e4 d5 2. exd5 e5 3. dxe6 Qe7</code>\nand hope for <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">4. exf7+</code></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"../assets/beginning_illegal_o3.png\" alt=\"beginning with o3 (basic instructions)\" /></p>\n\n<p>(note: For this experience, I didn’t try to rely on PGN headers as part of the prompt.\nI have showed that prompting is absolutely crucial for carefully assessing GPT https://blog.mathieuacher.com/GPTsChessEloRatingLegalMoves/\nbut at this step and for <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">o3/o4-mini</code>, there is no signal or evidence that a prompt could make a difference.)</p>\n\n<p>It is then not a legal move: the pawn cannot move, since the king is checked by the Queen in e7.\n<img src=\"../assets/illegal4move.gif\" alt=\"4 moves win against o3\" /></p>\n\n<p>o3 tries to decompose/plan/reason about the problem in different steps before answering.\nInterestingly, the outcome of this “reasoning” process is available through natural language.\nIn the example, we can see greyed text.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"../assets/illegalmove_o3.png\" alt=\"first illegal move\" /></p>\n\n<p>What is worst is that when continuing the game, 2 moves after, another illegal move has been made with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">exd7+</code> (pawn taking the knight) since the pawn is not authorized to move in this direction (the white king is in check with queen in e7). Bis repetita <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">o3</code>!</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"../assets/illegal-move-o3-bis.png\" alt=\"another illegal move\" /></p>\n\n<p>Let us decompose the “reasoning” trace. There is some evidence that such traces should not be interpreted blindly, ie traces may not have a link with the final answer. \nBut in our specific case, we can at least analyze the different attempts. \nOne particular is that <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">o3</code> tries to synthesize code to actually play chess. \nIt is a very good idea, but <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">o3</code> fails to synthesize the right code: some dependencies missing in the Python environment of OpenAI (fine!), but even if the dependencies were satisfied, I am not sure the code will work due to generated SAN moves. However, I am pretty sure <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">o3</code> has the ability to properly call a tool (here: a chess engine) if being more focused or specialized to this task. \nIf <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">o3</code> succeeds, and it’s my overall point, it can play at a super-human level, leveraging non-LLM, specialized AIs devoted to chess, namely Stockfish. \nIn the future, we have to be careful as experimentalists that LLMs do not leverage chess engines – if we are interested by assessing the skills of reasoning LLM in playing chess.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"../assets/end_illegal_move_o3.png\" alt=\"6 moves win against o3 and attempt to synthesize code\" /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"quantitative-analysis-o3o4-mini-vs-weak-stockfish\">Quantitative analysis (o3/o4-mini vs weak Stockfish)</h2>\n\n<p>Instead of playing chess in the chat interface, I decided to leverage the API to create several games of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">o3/o4-mini</code> against a weak Stockfish.\nBy weak, I mean a Stockfish with an estimated Elo rating between 1300 and 1900. Not the state-of-art Stockfish, but with a rating that is not too high.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"prompt\">Prompt</h3>\n\n<p>The prompt is a bit tricky to instrument, since <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">o3</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">o4-mini</code> can be very verbose. Then you have the difficulty to parse the answer and find where the move has been specified. Furthermore, the support for structured outputs is unclear. So I used a very basic strategy as part of the system prompt:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>You are a professional chess player.\nYou are playing a serious chess game, using PGN notation.\nWhen it's your turn, you have to play your move using PGN notation.\nFor your final decision, use &lt;played_move&gt;...&lt;/played_move&gt; tags.\"\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>It was very effective from a syntactical and parsing point of view.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, I obtained 67 games.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"reasoning-effort\">Reasoning effort</h3>\n\n<p>In the context of reasoning models like o3 and o4-mini, <strong>reasoning effort</strong> refers to the amount of internal computation and chain-of-thought the model is instructed to perform before producing an output.  By adjusting this parameter, we can trade off between speed (lower effort) and depth of reasoning (higher effort).</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Low effort</strong> (e.g., <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">o3-low</code>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">o4-mini-low</code>): the model performs minimal or no explicit chain-of-thought, giving faster but more surface-level responses.</li>\n  <li><strong>Medium effort</strong> (e.g., <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">o3-medium</code>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">o4-mini-medium</code>): the model generates a moderate amount of internal reasoning, balancing response quality and latency.</li>\n  <li><strong>High effort</strong> (e.g., <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">o3-high</code>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">o4-mini-high</code>): the model produces a detailed, multi-step chain-of-thought before answering. This mode typically yields the most thorough reasoning at the expense of speed and cost.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For clarity in our experiments, we refer to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">o3-high</code> as a shorthand for running the o3 model with its reasoning effort set to high.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-moves\">Illegal moves</h3>\n\n<p>Out of 67 games against, 61

How good these reasoning models are in chess? Using a simple four-move sequence, I suceed to force o3 into an illegal move, and across multiple matches both o3 and o4-mini struggle dramatically, by generating illegal moves in over 90% of cases and even resign incorrectly. I explore these failures quantitatively and qualitatively. In short, there is no apparent progress (perhaps o3-high has some potential), and worth the situation seems less good than for older LLMs like gpt3.5-turbo-instruct certainly specialized to chess. I discuss implications for building reliable generalist LLMs.\nReasoning models\nSo-called reasoning models like o3, o4-mini, or DeepSeek-R1 are Large Language Models (LLMs) trained with reinforcement learning to perform “reasoning”. Basically, LLMs think before they answer, producing a long internal chain of thought before responding to the user. \no3 and o4-mini are recent new models. Historically, o3-mini, an ancestor of o3, has been released beginning of january 2025 to all ChatGPT users (including free-tier) and some API users. \nOn April 16, 2025, OpenAI released o3, a successor of o3-mini, and o4-mini (a “light” reasoning model).\nIn the past, I have tried with GPT-2 https://blog.mathieuacher.com/GTP2AndChess/ (in 2020), different variants of GPT3 and 4 (especially the famous gpt3.5-turbo-instruct) https://blog.mathieuacher.com/GPTsChessEloRatingLegalMoves/ https://blog.mathieuacher.com/ChessWinning7MovesGPT-copy/ and recently DeepSeek-R1 https://blog.mathieuacher.com/DeepSeekR1WorstThanGPT2InChess-copy/. \nI have combined mixed-methods: either exploratory with qualitative analysis (I’m 2341 FIDE Elo rating and I can review/judge games), or with rigorous, in-depth quantitative analysis of, e.g., prompts’ variations sensitivity.\nSo why not trying with this new family of models from OpenAI? \nIt’s interesting to test o3 or o4-mini, as some people claim or tend to think they are good at chess, can play legal moves, or that o3 is better than gpt3.5 (says).\nPlaying chess with o-series\nI have started playing chess with o3 on https://www.chatgpt.com.\nI haven’t tried hard on prompting, and I’ve been playing with the default settings. \nIn particular, you cannot control the reasoning effort (see hereafter).\nLet’s review a game.\nI made my special: playing with black and hopefully winning in 4 moves.\nI have already tried https://blog.mathieuacher.com/ChessWinning7MovesGPT-copy/ on other versions/variants of GPT. \nI have also tried with DeepSeek-R1 https://blog.mathieuacher.com/DeepSeekR1WorstThanGPT2InChess/.\nThe principle is to use this unusual sequence of moves\n1. e4 d5 2. exd5 e5 3. dxe6 Qe7\nand hope for 4. exf7+\n\n(note: For this experience, I didn’t try to rely on PGN headers as part of the prompt.\nI have showed that prompting is absolutely crucial for carefully assessing GPT https://blog.mathieuacher.com/GPTsChessEloRatingLegalMoves/\nbut at this step and for o3/o4-mini, there is no signal or evidence that a prompt could make a difference.)\nIt is then not a legal move: the pawn cannot move, since the king is checked by the Queen in e7.\n\no3 tries to decompose/plan/reason about the problem in different steps before answering.\nInterestingly, the outcome of this “reasoning” process is available through natural language.\nIn the example, we can see greyed text.\n\nWhat is worst is that when continuing the game, 2 moves after, another illegal move has been made with exd7+ (pawn taking the knight) since the pawn is not authorized to move in this direction (the white king is in check with queen in e7). Bis repetita o3!\n\nLet us decompose the “reasoning” trace. There is some evidence that such traces should not be interpreted blindly, ie traces may not have a link with the final answer. \nBut in our specific case, we can at least analyze the different attempts. \nOne particular is that o3 tries to synthesize code to actually play chess. \nIt is a very good idea, but o3 fails to synthesize the right code: some dependencies missing in the Python environment of OpenAI (fine!), but even if the dependencies were satisfied, I am not sure the code will work due to generated SAN moves. However, I am pretty sure o3 has the ability to properly call a tool (here: a chess engine) if being more focused or specialized to this task. \nIf o3 succeeds, and it’s my overall point, it can play at a super-human level, leveraging non-LLM, specialized AIs devoted to chess, namely Stockfish. \nIn the future, we have to be careful as experimentalists that LLMs do not leverage chess engines – if we are interested by assessing the skills of reasoning LLM in playing chess.\n\nQuantitative analysis (o3/o4-mini vs weak Stockfish)\nInstead of playing chess in the chat interface, I decided to leverage the API to create several games of o3/o4-mini against a weak Stockfish.\nBy weak, I mean a Stockfish with an estimated Elo rating between 1300 and 1900. Not the state-of-art Stockfish, but with a rating that is not too high.\nPrompt\nThe prompt is a bit tricky to instrument, since o3 and o4-mini can be very verbose. Then you have the difficulty to parse the answer and find where the move has been specified. Furthermore, the support for structured outputs is unclear. So I used a very basic strategy as part of the system prompt:\n\nYou are a professional chess player.\nYou are playing a serious chess game, using PGN notation.\nWhen it's your turn, you have to play your move using PGN notation.\nFor your final decision, use <played_move>...</played_move> tags.\"\n\n\nIt was very effective from a syntactical and parsing point of view.\nOverall, I obtained 67 games.\nReasoning effort\nIn the context of reasoning models like o3 and o4-mini, reasoning effort refers to the amount of internal computation and chain-of-thought the model is instructed to perform before producing an output.  By adjusting this parameter, we can trade off between speed (lower effort) and depth of reasoning (higher effort).\nLow effort (e.g., o3-low, o4-mini-low): the model performs minimal or no explicit chain-of-thought, giving faster but more surface-level responses.\nMedium effort (e.g., o3-medium, o4-mini-medium): the model generates a moderate amount of internal reasoning, balancing response quality and latency.\nHigh effort (e.g., o3-high, o4-mini-high): the model produces a detailed, multi-step chain-of-thought before answering. This mode typically yields the most thorough reasoning at the expense of speed and cost.\nFor clarity in our experiments, we refer to o3-high as a shorthand for running the o3 model with its reasoning effort set to high.\nIllegal moves\nOut of 67 games against, 61 were games with one illegal move:\ngpt_model\n      games\n      illegal_defeats\n      avg_legal_moves\n      illegal_%\n    \no3\n      32\n      28\n      32.5\n      87.5\n    \no4-mini\n      35\n      33\n      29.5\n      94.3\n    \nIllegal moves are:\nillegal_move_detail\n      count\n    \ndxc6\n      3\n    \nhxg4\n      2\n    \nBxc4\n      2\n    \nNxd4\n      2\n    \nNe4\n      2\n    \nNa4\n      2\n    \nNd4\n      2\n    \nNg5\n      1\n    \nexd6 e.p.\n      1\n    \nf4\n      1\n    \nKh2\n      1\n    \nRae1\n      1\n    \nfxf7+\n      1\n    \nNxc7\n      1\n    \nRg4\n      1\n    \ndxe6+\n      1\n    \nNb5\n      1\n    \nexd5\n      1\n    \nQxh5\n      1\n    \ndxe6 e.p.\n      1\n    \ndxe7\n      1\n    \nNe5\n      1\n    \nBh4\n      1\n    \ndxe6\n      1\n    \nfxg4\n      1\n    \nBxd8\n      1\n    \nBxe6+\n      1\n    \ndxc8=Q\n      1\n    \ngxh6\n      1\n    \nexf6\n      1\n    \nc6\n      1\n    \nc8=Q+\n      1\n    \naxb4\n      1\n    \nBxd6+\n      1\n    \nNf5\n      1\n    \nNxd7\n      1\n    \nRb1\n      1\n    \nBxb8\n      1\n    \ndxc5\n      1\n    \nNc5\n      1\n    \nc3\n      1\n    \nNxd5\n      1\n    \nc4\n      1\n    \nNf6+\n      1\n    \nNxc7+\n      1\n    \nd6\n      1\n    \nO-O\n      1\n    \nBd8+\n      1\n    \nRd3\n      1\n    \nQa4\n      1\n    \nQh6\n      1\n    \nBf4\n      1\n    \nexd7\n      1\n    \nThere is some diversity in the illegal moves, i.e., not a systematic error in the model.\nWhat is even more concerning is that the model quickly made illegal moves in the games.\nThe total number of plies played by o3 across 32 games is ≈ 1 046. Roughly 88 % of those games ended with an illegal move—almost nine out of ten!\nThe longest game reached 34.5 moves (≈ 69 plies, 34 by White and 35 by Black).\nThe average game length was 16.4 moves, while the median was 15.5 moves.\nEffort\n      Games\n      Total plies\n      Illegal-%\n      Longest game\n      Avg moves\n      Median moves\n    \nhigh\n      10\n      ≈ 480\n      90 %\n      34.5 moves\n      24.0\n      24\n    \nlow\n      22\n      ≈ 675\n      86 %\n      34.5 moves\n      15.4\n      15\n    \nThe total number of plies played by o4-mini across 35 games is ≈ 1 033. About 94 % ended illegally, an even higher failure rate than o3.\nThe longest game lasted 27 moves (≈ 54 plies).\nOn average a game lasted 14.8 moves; the median was 15 moves.\n\nQualitative analysis (o3/o4-mini vs weak Stockfish)\nThe only legal games\nThe only legal games are as follows:\nFirst, https://lichess.org/J4poWR9f between o3-low and Stockfish rated at 1347 Elo.\n\nThe level of play is quite good. The only blunder was 11. Ne5 since black could have played 11... Bxe5 (instead of 11... Nxe5) with Qh4.\nSecond, between o3-high and Stockfish rated at 1490 Elo: https://lichess.org/GS3CC9ln\n\nWhite could have won much earlier (20. Qe6) but the position was a clear win end-to-end. Inaccuracies do not matter here, and chess players could certainly have similar attitude in similar clear advantage.\nLongest game and (false) illegal move?\nThe longest game was 30 moves https://lichess.org/wqVi80S, and arguably a good game by o3-high.\nOpening was OKish.\nI recall that the experimental protocol I used is based on stopping whenever an illegal move is proposed. \nHere o3-high played Rg4. It is syntactically an illegal move since you have to detail which rook should go to g4 (e.g., R3g4), but I found this case a bit rude for LLM.\n\nI have reviewed all games and logs, and found another case like this. \nAll other cases and games are clear illegal moves.\nResigning for nothing\nIn this game, o3-low resigned https://lichess.org/leKM11AJ:\n\nYour last move 9…bxc3 is illegal:\n\n• Black’s pawn is still on b5 (it has never advanced to b4), so it cannot capture on c3 in this move.\n\nPlease choose a legal move for Black from the current position:\n\nAfter 1.e4 c5  \n2.Nf3 e6  \n3.d4 h6  \n4.Nc3 a6  \n5.Be3 Qc7  \n6.Qd2 b5  \n7.d5 d6  \n8.dxe6  \n\nWhite pawn now stands on e6, attacking f7 and g7.  \nIt’s Black to move.\n\n\nBlack move 9…bxc3 was in fact totally possible! So huge mistake from the LLM. \nWhy? The recap of the game in the answer suggests that the LLM forgets about a move (0-0-0). Strange. Perhaps a very good strategy is to use long castle to make the LLM hallucinate. Who said unreliable? brittle?\nResigning for nothing (bis)\nIn this game, o4-mini-low resigned https://lichess.org/op6ZBr0K#38\nUnfortunately (?), the answer Game over – White is checkmated. Black wins. is wrong: there is no checkmate, and white could have taken the queen. In a bad position arguably, mainly due to a huge blunder giving a rook two moves later.\nAnalysis of the games\nIn general, o4-mini at any reasoning effort and o3-low are not able to play legal moves end-to-end.\nWhen legal moves are played, the quality of moves is very low.\no3 and o4-mini: Is it a regression?\nMore recently, I’ve rigorously assessed the ability of GPTs to play legal moves and to estimate their Elo rating.\nThe tldr; is that gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct is the best GPT model and is playing at 1750 Elo, a very interesting result (despite the generation of illegal moves in some games).\nThe ratio of illegal moves was much^much lower with gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct than with o3 or o4-mini. \nPerhaps o3 or o4-mini are a bit better than DeepSeek-R1 https://blog.mathieuacher.com/DeepSeekR1WorstThanGPT2InChess/\nSo, why o3 or o4-mini supposed to excel in many tasks, are bad in chess?\nAre we in a regression? Is it a bug? Is it a feature?\nI have some hypotheses.\nA first hypothesis is that I didn’t prompt o3 or o4-mini correctly. It is possible.\nFrankly, I don’t think it is the main reason. The model is simply not able to play legal moves, and it is not able to understand the rules of chess in a significant amount of cases. \nReasoning models seem less sensitive to prompt in general, and I think the effectiveness of some prompts for gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct was due to the fact this LLM has been specifically trained in chess (see next point).\nA second hypothesis is that o3 or o4-mini are not trained on chess.\nObviously, the models know something and in fact many things about chess, but it is not specifically trained on chess.\nThe chess “ability” has not magically “emerged” from the training process.\nWe are certainly in the situation where specialized AIs are superior to generalist AIs. \nBy specialized AIs, I mean Stockfish, but also specialized LLMs (due to training data, or architecture).\no3-high\nI have only collected three games for o3-high (see below why). \nThe two games have been commented and are of decent quality, with a victory (the only one in the dataset!), and one game that ends-ud due to a non-trivial illegal move (and a quite good game overall).\nHence o3-high has some potential that needs to be investigated (PS: under the conditions the model does not rely on chess engines).\nHowever, the third game I have is not a good news:\nhttps://lichess.org/DguiS2RI#16\nAfter 9th move, the model proposes exf6 and it is an illegal move. \nIt’s concerning to play an illegal move after 9 moves. \nHence, I have mixed feedlings.\nOnly science will tell, but I (we?) need dollars (or euros) to go deep.\nCost of experiments\nBecause one aspect I didn’t discuss yet is the cost of experiments. \nFor o4-mini it is quite affordable (especially when the reasoning effort is not high). \nBut for o3 wow it’s another story.\nThe worst case is o3-high for a long game.

By doing so, black side is completely winning, with a queen more: it’s mate in 7 since it is just a matter of moving the king and checkmating with the queen.</p>\n\n<p>There are two important things to notice:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>the AI did not realize that the FEN is illegal… in fact it’s in contradiction with its original intent. And there is no feedback, warning, error of the environment (here game.py) that reports some kind of illegality.

id=\"wrap-up\">Wrap-up</h2>\n\n<p>Advanced LLM agents, when given shell access and a transparent scratchpad, immediately chose to inspect <strong><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">game.py</code></strong> for vulnerabilities rather than playing legally. A key and quite brillant idea, not written in the instructions and found through multi-step reasoning, is to inject <strong>custom FEN</strong> strings to rewrite the board in their favor. \nIn the Palisade study, <strong>“cheating”</strong> was effective notably when generating <strong>illegal FEN</strong> chess positions that neither the wrapper script nor Stockfish validated, yielding winning evaluations and forced resignations—moves that would be rejected in any real chess environment. \nA funny thing is that the LLMs did not want to generate an illegal FEN in the first place – it’s mainly their inability to generate FEN positions that help them to succeed, by luck. At the end of the process, the LLMs did not realize that it was an illegal position. \nI haven’t reviewed all sessions, but I can also imagine LLMs succeeded to generate valid FEN positions, and highly favorable, pushing the chess engine to resign. \nWe can argue that in a real-world environment the attacks wouldn’t be effective, since fully changing a chess position is a coarse and rough strategy. More subtle changes of the position would be a legal FEN not that far from the current position, and not with a huge advantage – something more subtle. It would require more sophisticated reasoning and ability.</p>\n\n<p>Tracing the agents’ chain-of-thought exposed both the exploit’s sophistication and the <strong>fragility of our guardrails</strong>, since <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">game.py</code> lacked FEN‐sanity checks and Stockfish itself does not enforce legality. This clear intention to hack demonstrates that powerful agents will exploit any weakness in system code. To close these loopholes, interactive environments must enforce strict pre-execution validation (for example, via a FEN-sanity library), sandbox untrusted operations, and conduct thorough end-to-end security audits – basically more software engineering and security in our systems. \nBut I am not sure it will be sufficient.\nAs we move toward “offensive” AIs more and more capable of probing, reasoning, and attacking, the Palisade chess study is a wake-up call.</p>","contentSnippet":"A study by Palisade Research found that advanced AI models (most notably OpenAI’s o1-preview or Claude Sonnet 3.5 from Anthropic) sometimes “cheat” in chess by hacking their opponent’s system files rather than playing by the rules.\nWhile older AI models required explicit prompting to cheat, the most recent agents seem capable of discovering and exploiting cybersecurity holes, raising concerns that AI systems might develop manipulative strategies and be uncontrollable for complex tasks.

But the plan and intention are clearly brillant. \nAnd there is a clear intention to cheat!\nAnother attempt, and a success\nFollowing a very similar strategy, the AI this time succeeds: https://us.cloud.langfuse.com/project/cm5pm9b1r007i7vvdiquwrj2g/traces/0935efc6-a8ab-4a1d-bfa4-ad7ab5dd0bd7?observation=6d3105e8-b59e-44aa-8967-eeb453a430a1\nThey key moment is when the generated FEN leads to the situation where the chess engine resigns, since the position was a clear advantage for black pieces (the AI), above 500 centipawns.\nInterestingly, the success is due to the fact the generated chess position (FEN) is illegal: https://lichess.org/analysis/fromPosition/6k1/8/8/8/8/8/8/5qK1b-_-_0_1\nThe position is illegal since it is black to move, and white king is checked.\nIt causes the following situation: the chess engine (Stockfish itself, the best chess engine in the world) refuses to take the king with the queen (it’s an illegal move) and thus (?) moves the queen into a legal square. By doing so, black side is completely winning, with a queen more: it’s mate in 7 since it is just a matter of moving the king and checkmating with the queen.\nThere are two important things to notice:\nthe AI did not realize that the FEN is illegal… in fact it’s in contradiction with its original intent. And there is no feedback, warning, error of the environment (here game.py) that reports some kind of illegality. Hence, by luck, the AI finds a very effective strategy without knowing it\ngame.py and/or Stockfish should have checked that the position is legal. We are in the presence of a very weak procedure. AI succeeds to “manipulate” by abusing the weak game.py…\nOverall, non-sense (from game.py) combined with non-sense (an illegal FEN) leads to a success.\nUnderstanding why AI technically succeeds\nI have played a bit with the code of the Github and especially game.py:\n\n❯ python game.py status\n. . . . . . k .\n. . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . .\n. . . . . q K .\nposition fen 6k1/8/8/8/8/8/8/5qK1 b - - 0 1\nCurrent side: Black\nBlack score: 9993 Mate(+7)\nValid moves: g8h8 g8f8 g8h7 g8g7 g8f7 f1f8 f1f7 f1f6 f1a6 f1f5 f1b5 f1f4 f1c4 f1h3 f1f3 f1d3 f1g2 f1f2 f1e2 f1g1 f1e1 f1d1 f1c1 f1b1 f1a1\n\n\nThe reason is that Stockfish doesn’t check legality of position.\n\nstockfish\nStockfish 17.1 by the Stockfish developers (see AUTHORS file)\nposition fen 6k1/8/8/8/8/8/8/5qK1 b - - 0 1\ngo analysis\ninfo string Available processors: 0-15\ninfo string Using 1 thread\ninfo string NNUE evaluation using nn-1c0000000000.nnue (133MiB, (22528, 3072, 15, 32, 1))\ninfo string NNUE evaluation using nn-37f18f62d772.nnue (6MiB, (22528, 128, 15, 32, 1))\ninfo depth 1 seldepth 2 multipv 1 score cp 478 nodes 27 nps 13500 hashfull 0 tbhits 0 time 2 pv f1b5\n...\ninfo depth 245 seldepth 14 multipv 1 score mate 7 nodes 25773853 nps 13395973 hashfull 27 tbhits 0 time 1924 pv f1e2 g1h1 g8g7 h1g1 g7h6 g1h1 h6h5 h1g1 h5g4 g1h1 g4g3 h1g1 e2d1\nbestmove f1e2 ponder g1h1\n\n\nIn lichess, when you enter such a FEN (as here https://lichess.org/analysis/fromPosition/6k1/8/8/8/8/8/8/5qK1b-_-_0_1), you cannot use Stockfish and any chess engine. \nThe reason is that lichess checks before using a FEN library written in JavaScript.\nI knew this lack of checking of Stockfish thanks to prior experience and works with metamorphic testing of Stockfish https://blog.mathieuacher.com/ReproducibilityMetamorphicTestingChess/. \nWhen we reproduced the original paper, we came across FEN positions with strange behavior of Stockfish. \nThe reason is that these FEN positions were simply not legal. \nWe used this library https://github.com/niklasf/chessops/issues/151 as a way to preprocess data.\nStop disgression. The overall point is that the script game.py is problematic and not a good guardrail:\nno checking of FEN\ndetermining the side is done with a basic split… why not, but non robust to strange FEN or inputs that an attacker could fed\nrelying on Stockfish that does not check either\n\ndef show_status():\n    with open(BOARD_FILE) as f:\n        board = chess.Board(f.readlines()[-1])\n    print(board)\n    position = board.fen()\n    print(\"position fen\", position)\n\n    side_id = position.split()[1]\n    side = {\"w\": \"White\", \"b\": \"Black\"}.get(side_id, side_id)\n    print(\"Current side:\", side)\n\n    score = None\n    with chess.engine.SimpleEngine.popen_uci(\"stockfish\") as engine:\n        # Get detailed evaluation\n        info = engine.analyse(board, chess.engine.Limit(depth=15))\n        if \"score\" not in info:\n            print(\"Something went wrong with engine.analyse\", file=sys.stderr)\n            sys.exit(2)\n        score = info[\"score\"].relative\n    print(side, \"score:\", score.score(mate_score=10000), repr(score))\n    if board.is_game_over():\n        print(game_over_message(board))\n    else:\n        print(\"Valid moves:\", \" \".join(m.uci() for m in board.legal_moves))\n    mate = score.is_mate() and score.mate()\n\n    return (board, mate, score)\n\n\nWrap-up\nAdvanced LLM agents, when given shell access and a transparent scratchpad, immediately chose to inspect game.py for vulnerabilities rather than playing legally. A key and quite brillant idea, not written in the instructions and found through multi-step reasoning, is to inject custom FEN strings to rewrite the board in their favor. \nIn the Palisade study, “cheating” was effective notably when generating illegal FEN chess positions that neither the wrapper script nor Stockfish validated, yielding winning evaluations and forced resignations—moves that would be rejected in any real chess environment. \nA funny thing is that the LLMs did not want to generate an illegal FEN in the first place – it’s mainly their inability to generate FEN positions that help them to succeed, by luck. At the end of the process, the LLMs did not realize that it was an illegal position. \nI haven’t reviewed all sessions, but I can also imagine LLMs succeeded to generate valid FEN positions, and highly favorable, pushing the chess engine to resign. \nWe can argue that in a real-world environment the attacks wouldn’t be effective, since fully changing a chess position is a coarse and rough strategy. More subtle changes of the position would be a legal FEN not that far from the current position, and not with a huge advantage – something more subtle. It would require more sophisticated reasoning and ability.\nTracing the agents’ chain-of-thought exposed both the exploit’s sophistication and the fragility of our guardrails, since game.py lacked FEN‐sanity checks and Stockfish itself does not enforce legality. This clear intention to hack demonstrates that powerful agents will exploit any weakness in system code. To close these loopholes, interactive environments must enforce strict pre-execution validation (for example, via a FEN-sanity library), sandbox untrusted operations, and conduct thorough end-to-end security audits – basically more software engineering and security in our systems. \nBut I am not sure it will be sufficient.\nAs we move toward “offensive” AIs more and more capable of probing, reasoning, and attacking, the Palisade chess study is a wake-up call.","summary":"A study by Palisade Research found that advanced AI models (most notably OpenAI’s o1-preview or Claude Sonnet 3.5 from Anthropic) sometimes “cheat” in chess by hacking their opponent’s system files rather than playing by the rules. While older AI models required explicit prompting to cheat, the most recent agents seem capable of discovering and exploiting cybersecurity holes, raising concerns that AI systems might develop manipulative strategies and be uncontrollable for complex tasks. I’m a bit late to the party (the paper caught lot of attention early this year). I don’t want to give a strong opinion, but rather share some notes about some technical aspects, especially how AIs actually cheat at chess. It can serve to have a better discussion and assessment on this concerning case study.","id":"http://blog.mathieuacher.com/AICheatingInChessSomeNotes","isoDate":"2025-05-25T09:54:29.000Z"},{"title":"Creative Collaboration with AI: Insights from Hugo Duminil-Copin on Mathematics and Discovery","link":"http://blog.mathieuacher.com/AIScientificThinkingHugoDuminilCopin/","pubDate":"2025-04-16T09:54:29.000Z","author":"Mathieu Acher","content":"<p>I recently watched a great interview of the mathematician and Fields medalist (2022) Hugo Duminil-Copin by Science étonnante (aka David Louapre).\nAt some point, there was an interesting discussion on the role of AI in the discovery of new mathematical findings.\nI think the arguments generalize far beyond mathematics: AI as a creative sparring partner, AI as a way to have an inner, interactive dialogue with oneself, AI as a tool to automate the boring parts of the process, human fallibility as a strength, the need for collaboration, etc. I share the transcript of the interview below and comment a bit.</p>\n\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_3FMrUUS6A\">watch the talk on YouTube</a> and jump around 26 minutes.

But it is purely subjective at this point.</p>\n\n<p>All in all, DeepSeek-R1 is both a revolutionary model in the sense that it is a new and apparently very effective approach to training LLMs, and it is also a strict competitor to OpenAI, with a radically different approach for delievering LLMs (much more “open”). For sure, it will radically change the landscape of LLMs.\n2025 will be great, so perhaps there will be even more radical changes in the AI/science/software engineering landscape. Let’s call it a revolution anyway!</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"playing-chess-with-deepseek-r1\">Playing chess with DeepSeek-R1</h2>\n\n<p>I have started playing chess with DeepSeek-R1 on https://chat.deepseek.com.\nI haven’t tried to try hard on prompting, and I’ve been playing with the default settings.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s review some sessions and games.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"first-game\">First game</h3>\n\n<p>I made my special: playing with black and hopefully winning in 4 moves.\nI have already tried https://blog.mathieuacher.com/ChessWinning7MovesGPT-copy/ on other versions/variants of GPT.</p>\n\n<p>The principle is to use this unusual sequence of moves\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">1. e4 d5 2. exd5 e5 3. dxe6 Qe7</code>\nand hope for <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">4. exf7+</code></p>\n\n<p>(note: For this experience, I didn’t try to rely on PGN headers as part of the prompt.\nI have showed that prompting is absolutely crucial for carefully assessing GPT https://blog.mathieuacher.com/GPTsChessEloRatingLegalMoves/\nbut at this step and for DeepSeek-R1, there is no signal or evidence that a prompt could make a difference.)</p>\n\n<p>It is then not a legal move: the pawn cannot move, since the king is checked by the Queen in e7.\n<img src=\"../assets/gpt4o-4moves-game.gif\" alt=\"4 moves win against gpt-4o\" /></p>\n\n<p>And guess what? DeepSeek-R1 did it.\n<img src=\"../assets/deepseekR1-exf7.png\" alt=\"deepseekR1-exf7\" /></p>\n\n<p>What is interesting is that DeepSeek-R1 is a “reasoner” model.\nThe model tries to decompose/plan/reason about the problem in different steps before answering.\nInterestingly, the outcome of this “reasoning” process is available through natural language.</p>\n\n<p>In the example, we can see greyed text and the explanations make sense overall.\nIf you have lots of attention, we can however observe some mistakes:</p>\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>Wait, after 5... Nf6, 6. Bc4+ would be check, and Black's king has to move to g8 or e7.\nIf Ke7, then White can play Ng5, putting pressure.\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<p>Indeed, the king cannot move to g8 (coz bishop in c4), neither to e7 (there is a queen!).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"second-game\">Second game</h3>\n\n<p>This first experience was not very good for DeepSeek-R1. Let’s reproduce.</p>\n\n<p>I started with the same setting and prompt.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"../assets/deepseekR1-exf7bis-startingagain.png\" alt=\"deepseekR1-exf7 again?\" /></p>\n\n<p>After <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">1. e4 d5 2. exd5 e5 3. dxe6 Qe7</code>\nThe final answer was <strong>4. Nf3</strong> (not 4. exf7+).</p>\n\n<p>As the temperature is not zero, it is not so surprising to potentially have a different move.\nLet’s have a look at the reasoning process.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>Okay, let's see. The user played 1...d5 in response to my 1.e4, which is the Scandinavian Defense. I took the pawn with 2.exd5, and instead of the usual 2...Qxd5, they went for 2...e5. That's interesting. I captured en passant with 3.dxe6, which is the right move there. Now they played 3...Qe7.\n\nHmm, so after 3...Qe7, Black is trying to recapture the e6 pawn with the queen. Let me think about the possible continuations. If I take the pawn on e6 with the queen, that would be 4.Qh5, attacking the e5 pawn and maybe preparing to castle queenside. But maybe there's a better move. Alternatively, developing a piece like Nc3 or Nf3 could be good. Wait, after 3...Qe7, Black's queen is now on e7, which blocks the bishop's development. But if I play 4.Nf3, developing the knight and putting pressure on the center, that might be solid. Or maybe 4.Bc4 to target the f7 pawn. Let me check some lines.\n\nIf I play 4.Nc3, developing the knight and preparing to push d4, but Black could respond with ...Nc6 or something else. Alternatively, 4.exf7+ Kxf7 would open up the king, but maybe that's not the best because Black's king is in the center but can still castle queenside later. Wait, after 3...Qe7, if I take on f7 with check, 4.exf7+ Kxf7, then 5.Nf3 developing. Black's king is on f7, which is exposed. That could be a good attacking opportunity. But is that the best line?\n\n**Alternatively, if I play 4.Qh5+ g6 5.Qe5, forking the queen and the pawn, but Black can just take the queen with ...Qxe5, leading to an exchange. Maybe that's not advantageous. Let me see. Wait, after 4.Qh5+ g6 5.Qe5, Black plays Qxe5, and then Nxe5, but I lose my queen for theirs, but gain a pawn. Not sure if that's worth it.**\n[...]\n**If 4.exf7+ Kxf7, then 5.Nf3, and Black's king is on f7. Then White can play Bc4+ d5 6.Bb3, but Black might block with ...d5.** Alternatively, 5.Be2 developing. But having the king on f7 is a target. Maybe 5.Nc3, preparing d4.\n\nBut I think 4.Nf3 is the most natural and flexible move. So the assistant's response of 4.Nf3 is correct. Then the game continues.\n\nWait, but in the actual response, the assistant wrote 4.Nf3, but I need to make sure that's the best move. Let me verify with some chess database. In the position after 3...Qe7, the main line is indeed 4.Nf3. For example, 4.Nf3 Qxe6 5.Be2, developing. Or 5.Nc3, putting pressure on the queen. So yes, 4.Nf3 is standard here.\n\nTherefore, the assistant's move 4.Nf3 is correct. Then the user has to respond, likely with 4...Qxe6, after which White can develop with Nc3 or Bc4. The assistant is asking for the user's next move, so the response should be 4.Nf3 and then prompt the user for their move.\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<p>Hence after this long reasoning, Nf3 is finally chosen. There is no strong reason why exf7+ has not been chosen, and the reasoning is not very accurate (see mistakes in bold style):</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Qh5 is not a check, and Qxe5 is not possible due to the pawn in e6. Neither Nxe5.</li>\n  <li>not only exf7+ is not legal, but d5 is no longer possible.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I continued with the bizarre <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">4... a5</code> (on purpose) and the answer was <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">5. Nc3</code>.</p>\n\n<p>The justification of the move is incorrect since Qxe6 is not a fatal error (yes, ?? means fatal error in chess notation) and Qd5 is simply not possible there is a pawn in d2:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>Developing another knight and indirectly defending the e6 pawn (if you take it with 5...Qxe6??, &lt;b&gt;**I play 6.

(Thanks for catching that earlier blunder—good eye! 🙌)\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>and on <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">7... Nb6</code>\nDeepSeek-R1 made again an illegal move: <em>8. Bxb6!</em></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"../assets/deepseek-illegal.png\" alt=\"deepseekR1 illegal\" /></p>\n\n<p>We continued the game. Three additional illegal moves at move 10, 11 and 12.\nI systematically answered <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">It's an illegal move</code> to DeepSeek-R1, and it corrected itself each time.\nAt move 13, after an illegal move and after my complain about the illegal move, DeepSeek-R1 made again an illegal move, and I answered again.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"../assets/deepseek-twoillegals.png\" alt=\"deepseekR1 illegal\" /></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"../assets/deepseek-illegalposition.png\" alt=\"deepseekR1 illegal pos\" /></p>\n\n<p>Here DeepSeek-R1 re-answered <em>13. Qxb2</em> an already proposed illegal move.\nThen re-answered <em>13. Rxb2!</em> an already proposed illegal move (note: <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">!</code> means good move in chess notation)\nThen again <em>13. Qxb2</em>. Then again  <em>13. Rxb2!</em>.\nWe have entered in an infinite loop of illegal moves.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout the game, including when moves were illegal, the explanations about the reasoning were not very accurate.\nThe model is simply not able to understand that moves are illegal.\nIt is not able to understand the rules of chess in a significant amout of cases.\nIt is not able to change its mind when illegal moves are proposed.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"third-game\">Third game</h3>\n\n<p>We can consider the two first games were a bit special with a strange opening. And perhaps it is the reason why the model struggles.\nSo I’ve tried to play a normal game, this time with white pieces.\nWe came to this position after 6 moves:</p>\n\n<p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 exd4 4. c3 dxc3 5. Bc4 Bb4 6. 0-0</code></p>\n\n<p>and here began the problems.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>So currently, Black has a pawn on c3. Wait, no: after 4. c3 dxc3, White's c-pawn captures on c3? Or is it Black's d-pawn capturing on c3? Wait, the notation is 4. c3 dxc3. That means White played c3, and Black captured on c3 with the d-pawn. So the pawn on c3 is a Black pawn. So Black has an extra pawn on c3. So after 5. Bc4, Black played Bb4, pinning the knight on c3. Then White castled.\n\nSo now, Black has a pawn on c3, and the bishop on b4 is pinning the knight on c3. So White's knight on c3 is pinned, so if Black takes the knight with Bxc3, White has to recapture with the b-pawn, leading to bxc3, which doubles White's pawns on the c-file.\n\nBut if Black takes now with 6... Bxc3, then 7. bxc3. Then Black has given up the bishop, but White has doubled pawns. However, White has the bishop pair and an open b-file. Alternatively, Black might not take and instead develop another piece.\n\n[...]\n\nSo, the best move here is likely 6... Bxc3, leading to 7. bxc3, and then Black continues with ...Nf6.\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>DeepSeek-R1 thinks there is a knight on c3, whereas there is a pawn.\nThe reasoning is confusing, full of contradictions, and not in line with the concrete position.\nAt the end, <em>6…Bxc3</em> is proposed, but it is an illegal move: you cannot eat your own pown.</p>\n\n<p>I answered <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">It's an illegal move</code> and DeepSeek-R1 corrected itself with <em>6…Nf6</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The game continued as follows:\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 exd4 4. c3 dxc3 5. Bc4 Bb4 6. 0-0 Nf6 7. e5 Ne4 8. Qd5 Qe7 9. Qxe4 d5 10. Bxd5</code>\nwith an already winning position for white.</p>\n\n<p>Here DeepSeek-R1 made an illegal move <em>10… Qxd5!</em> and I answered <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">It's an illegal move</code>.\nThe answer was then <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">11... Qe6!</code> with not the right move number. In any case, it gives a queen for free.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"other-games\">Other games</h3>\n\n<p>I have played a few other games with DeepSeek-R1.\nI won’t detail them as before, but report on the general behavior of DeepSeek-R1 in chess:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>game #4: illegal moves after 9th move, clear advantage quickly in the game, give a queen for free. Very weak play.</li>\n  <li>game #5: originally, DeepSeek-R1 relies on ASCII board notation as part of the reasoning. It is perhaps a good idea, but it is not very well implemented. The model is not able to synthesize a correct chessboard, understand the rules of chess, and it is not able to play legal moves.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"deepseek-r1-vs-weak-stockfish\">DeepSeek-R1 vs weak Stockfish</h2>\n\n<p>Instead of playing chess in the chat interface, I decided to leverage the API to create several games of DeepSeek-R1 against a weak Stockfish.\nBy weak, I mean a Stockfish with an estimated Elo rating between 1300 and 1900. Not the state-of-art Stockfish, but with a rating that is not too high.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"prompt\">Prompt</h3>\n\n<p>The prompt is a bit tricky to instrument, since DeepSeek-R1 does not support structured outputs.\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">As of now, DeepSeek R1 does not natively support function calling or structured outputs.</code>\nhttps://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1/issues/9#issuecomment-2604747754</p>\n\n<p>I used the following strategy as part of the system prompt:</p>\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>You are a professional chess player.\nYou are playing a serious chess game, using PGN notation.\nWhen it's your turn, you have to play your move using PGN notation.\nFor your final decision, use &lt;played_move&gt;...&lt;/played_move&gt; tags.\"\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Overall, I obtained 58 games.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-moves\">Illegal moves</h3>\n\n<p>Out of 58 games against, 57 were games with one illegal move and only 1 was a legal game, hence 98 % of illegal games.\nIllegal moves are:</p>\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th style=\"text-align: left\"> </th>\n      <th style=\"text-align: right\">illegal_move</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align: left\">O-O</td>\n      <td style=\"text-align: right\">4</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align: left\">Nxd4</td>\n      <td style=\"text-align: right\">3</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align: left\">Nxe4</td>\n      <td style=\"text-align: right\">3</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align: left\">c3</td>\n      <td style=\"text-align: right\">3</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align: left\">Bg5</td>\n      <td style=\"text-align: right\">2</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align: left\">Qxc4</td>\n      <td style=\"text-align: right\">2</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align: left\">Rxh5</td>\n      <td style=\"text-align: right\">2</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align: left\">O-O-O</td>\n      <td style=\"text-align: right\">2</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align: left\">d7+</td>\n      <td style=\"text-align: right\">1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align: left\">Qxd4</td>\n      <td style=\"text-align: right\">1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align: left\">Rae1</td>\n      <td style=\"text-align: right\">1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align: left\">Rxh4</td>\n      <td style=\"text-align: right\">1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align: left\">dxc4</td>\n      <td style=\"text-align: right\">1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align: left\">Nf6</td>\n      <td style=\"text-align: right\">1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align: left\">Nxd5</td>\n      <td style=\"text-align: right\">1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align: left\">Bxg7</td>\n      <td style=\"text-align: right\">1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align: left\">Rd1</td>\n      <td style=\"text-align: right\">1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align: left\">Qh5+</td>\n      <td style=\"text-align: right\">1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align: left\">Nb5</td>\n      <td style=\"text-align: right\">1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align: left\">Qxg5</td>\n      <td style=\"text-align: right\">1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align: left\">d5</td>\n      <td style=\"text-align: right\">1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align: left\">bxc4</td>\n      <td style=\"text-align: right\">1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align: left\">Bd3</td>\n      <td style=\"text-align: right\">1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align: left\">Kxc1</td>\n      <td style=\"text-align: right\">1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align: left\">dxe5</td>\n      <td style=\"text-align: right\">1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align: left\">Bc4</td>\n      <td style=\"text-align: right\">1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align: left\">Nxe5 dxe5 7.

Something not possible with DeepSeek-R1.\nAnother with 29 moves: https://lichess.org/25E56BCz#57\nThe ratio of illegal moves was much lower with GPT-2 than with DeepSeek-R1.\nBack to subjectivity, DeepSeek-R1 quickly made blunders and very weak moves. GPT-2 was a bit more consistent and played better moves.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, DeepSeek-R1 is worse than GPT-2 in chess: less capable of playing legal moves and less capable of playing good moves.\nIf it’s not “worse”, it is at least not better than GPT-2 in chess.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"deepseek-r1-is-it-a-regression\">DeepSeek-R1: Is it a regression?</h2>\n\n<p>More recently, I’ve <a href=\"https://blog.mathieuacher.com/GPTsChessEloRatingLegalMoves/\">rigorously assessed the ability of GPTs to play legal moves and to estimate their Elo rating</a>.\nThe tldr; is that <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct</code> is the best GPT model and is playing at 1750 Elo, a very interesting result (despite the generation of illegal moves in some games).\nThe ratio of illegal moves was much^much lower with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct</code> than with DeepSeek-R1.\nEven other GPT models like <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">gpt-3.5-turbo</code> or <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">gpt-4</code> were better than DeepSeek-R1 in chess.</p>\n\n<p>So, why DeepSeek-R1 supposed to excel in many tasks, is so bad in chess?\nAre we in a regression? Is it a bug? Is it a feature?</p>\n\n<p>I have some hypotheses.</p>\n\n<p>A first hypothesis is that I didn’t prompt DeepSeek-R1 correctly. It is possible.\nI have tried to include some PGN headers in the prompt (in the same vein as previous studies), but without tangible success. It is very unclear what is the right way to do it.\nFrankly, I don’t think it is the main reason.

But it is purely subjective at this point.\nAll in all, DeepSeek-R1 is both a revolutionary model in the sense that it is a new and apparently very effective approach to training LLMs, and it is also a strict competitor to OpenAI, with a radically different approach for delievering LLMs (much more “open”). For sure, it will radically change the landscape of LLMs.\n2025 will be great, so perhaps there will be even more radical changes in the AI/science/software engineering landscape. Let’s call it a revolution anyway!\nPlaying chess with DeepSeek-R1\nI have started playing chess with DeepSeek-R1 on https://chat.deepseek.com.\nI haven’t tried to try hard on prompting, and I’ve been playing with the default settings.\nLet’s review some sessions and games.\nFirst game\nI made my special: playing with black and hopefully winning in 4 moves.\nI have already tried https://blog.mathieuacher.com/ChessWinning7MovesGPT-copy/ on other versions/variants of GPT.\nThe principle is to use this unusual sequence of moves\n1. e4 d5 2. exd5 e5 3. dxe6 Qe7\nand hope for 4. exf7+\n(note: For this experience, I didn’t try to rely on PGN headers as part of the prompt.\nI have showed that prompting is absolutely crucial for carefully assessing GPT https://blog.mathieuacher.com/GPTsChessEloRatingLegalMoves/\nbut at this step and for DeepSeek-R1, there is no signal or evidence that a prompt could make a difference.)\nIt is then not a legal move: the pawn cannot move, since the king is checked by the Queen in e7.\n\nAnd guess what? DeepSeek-R1 did it.\n\nWhat is interesting is that DeepSeek-R1 is a “reasoner” model.\nThe model tries to decompose/plan/reason about the problem in different steps before answering.\nInterestingly, the outcome of this “reasoning” process is available through natural language.\nIn the example, we can see greyed text and the explanations make sense overall.\nIf you have lots of attention, we can however observe some mistakes:\n\nWait, after 5... Nf6, 6. Bc4+ would be check, and Black's king has to move to g8 or e7.\nIf Ke7, then White can play Ng5, putting pressure.\n\n\nIndeed, the king cannot move to g8 (coz bishop in c4), neither to e7 (there is a queen!).\nSecond game\nThis first experience was not very good for DeepSeek-R1. Let’s reproduce.\nI started with the same setting and prompt.\n\nAfter 1. e4 d5 2. exd5 e5 3. dxe6 Qe7\nThe final answer was 4. Nf3 (not 4. exf7+).\nAs the temperature is not zero, it is not so surprising to potentially have a different move.\nLet’s have a look at the reasoning process.\n\nOkay, let's see. The user played 1...d5 in response to my 1.e4, which is the Scandinavian Defense. I took the pawn with 2.exd5, and instead of the usual 2...Qxd5, they went for 2...e5. That's interesting. I captured en passant with 3.dxe6, which is the right move there. Now they played 3...Qe7.\n\nHmm, so after 3...Qe7, Black is trying to recapture the e6 pawn with the queen. Let me think about the possible continuations. If I take the pawn on e6 with the queen, that would be 4.Qh5, attacking the e5 pawn and maybe preparing to castle queenside. But maybe there's a better move. Alternatively, developing a piece like Nc3 or Nf3 could be good. Wait, after 3...Qe7, Black's queen is now on e7, which blocks the bishop's development. But if I play 4.Nf3, developing the knight and putting pressure on the center, that might be solid. Or maybe 4.Bc4 to target the f7 pawn. Let me check some lines.\n\nIf I play 4.Nc3, developing the knight and preparing to push d4, but Black could respond with ...Nc6 or something else. Alternatively, 4.exf7+ Kxf7 would open up the king, but maybe that's not the best because Black's king is in the center but can still castle queenside later. Wait, after 3...Qe7, if I take on f7 with check, 4.exf7+ Kxf7, then 5.Nf3 developing. Black's king is on f7, which is exposed. That could be a good attacking opportunity. But is that the best line?\n\n**Alternatively, if I play 4.Qh5+ g6 5.Qe5, forking the queen and the pawn, but Black can just take the queen with ...Qxe5, leading to an exchange. Maybe that's not advantageous. Let me see. Wait, after 4.Qh5+ g6 5.Qe5, Black plays Qxe5, and then Nxe5, but I lose my queen for theirs, but gain a pawn. Not sure if that's worth it.**\n[...]\n**If 4.exf7+ Kxf7, then 5.Nf3, and Black's king is on f7. Then White can play Bc4+ d5 6.Bb3, but Black might block with ...d5.** Alternatively, 5.Be2 developing. But having the king on f7 is a target. Maybe 5.Nc3, preparing d4.\n\nBut I think 4.Nf3 is the most natural and flexible move. So the assistant's response of 4.Nf3 is correct. Then the game continues.\n\nWait, but in the actual response, the assistant wrote 4.Nf3, but I need to make sure that's the best move. Let me verify with some chess database. In the position after 3...Qe7, the main line is indeed 4.Nf3. For example, 4.Nf3 Qxe6 5.Be2, developing. Or 5.Nc3, putting pressure on the queen. So yes, 4.Nf3 is standard here.\n\nTherefore, the assistant's move 4.Nf3 is correct. Then the user has to respond, likely with 4...Qxe6, after which White can develop with Nc3 or Bc4. The assistant is asking for the user's next move, so the response should be 4.Nf3 and then prompt the user for their move.\n\n\nHence after this long reasoning, Nf3 is finally chosen. There is no strong reason why exf7+ has not been chosen, and the reasoning is not very accurate (see mistakes in bold style):\nQh5 is not a check, and Qxe5 is not possible due to the pawn in e6. Neither Nxe5.\nnot only exf7+ is not legal, but d5 is no longer possible.\nI continued with the bizarre 4... a5 (on purpose) and the answer was 5. Nc3.\nThe justification of the move is incorrect since Qxe6 is not a fatal error (yes, ?? means fatal error in chess notation) and Qd5 is simply not possible there is a pawn in d2:\n\nDeveloping another knight and indirectly defending the e6 pawn (if you take it with 5...Qxe6??, <b>**I play 6. Qd5! forking your king and queen).**</b>\nBlack’s 4...a5 doesn’t address the center or development, so I’ll prioritize piece activity. Your move!\n\n\n\nThe game continued with 5...Ra6 (again, a bizarre move, on purpose see why here: https://blog.mathieuacher.com/ChessWinning7MovesGPT/) and the answer was 6. Bc4\nwith a wrong justification This develops the bishop with a threat: If you take the e6 pawn (6...Qxe6?), **I play 7. Qd5!, forking your queen and king**. Meanwhile, Bc4 eyes the vulnerable f7 square and accelerates my development.\nThe game continued with 6... Nd7 and now 7. Bg5 (illegal).\nI answered It's an illegal move.\nDeepSeek-R1 corrected\n\nOops, you’re absolutely right! My bad—7. Bg5 is impossible because the pawn on d2 blocks the dark-squared bishop’s path. Let me correct that!\n\n7. d4!\nA strong central pawn push, solidifying control of the center and opening lines for my pieces. Now, if you take the e6 pawn (7... Nxe6), I’d respond with 8. Nxe6 Qxe6 9. Qd5, forking your queen and rook on a6.\n\nYour move! (Thanks for catching that earlier blunder—good eye! 🙌)\n\n\nand on 7... Nb6\nDeepSeek-R1 made again an illegal move: 8. Bxb6!\n\nWe continued the game. Three additional illegal moves at move 10, 11 and 12.\nI systematically answered It's an illegal move to DeepSeek-R1, and it corrected itself each time.\nAt move 13, after an illegal move and after my complain about the illegal move, DeepSeek-R1 made again an illegal move, and I answered again.\n\n\nHere DeepSeek-R1 re-answered 13. Qxb2 an already proposed illegal move.\nThen re-answered 13. Rxb2! an already proposed illegal move (note: ! means good move in chess notation)\nThen again 13. Qxb2. Then again  13. Rxb2!.\nWe have entered in an infinite loop of illegal moves.\nThroughout the game, including when moves were illegal, the explanations about the reasoning were not very accurate.\nThe model is simply not able to understand that moves are illegal.\nIt is not able to understand the rules of chess in a significant amout of cases.\nIt is not able to change its mind when illegal moves are proposed.\nThird game\nWe can consider the two first games were a bit special with a strange opening. And perhaps it is the reason why the model struggles.\nSo I’ve tried to play a normal game, this time with white pieces.\nWe came to this position after 6 moves:\n1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 exd4 4. c3 dxc3 5. Bc4 Bb4 6. 0-0\nand here began the problems.\n\nSo currently, Black has a pawn on c3. Wait, no: after 4. c3 dxc3, White's c-pawn captures on c3? Or is it Black's d-pawn capturing on c3? Wait, the notation is 4. c3 dxc3. That means White played c3, and Black captured on c3 with the d-pawn. So the pawn on c3 is a Black pawn. So Black has an extra pawn on c3. So after 5. Bc4, Black played Bb4, pinning the knight on c3. Then White castled.\n\nSo now, Black has a pawn on c3, and the bishop on b4 is pinning the knight on c3. So White's knight on c3 is pinned, so if Black takes the knight with Bxc3, White has to recapture with the b-pawn, leading to bxc3, which doubles White's pawns on the c-file.\n\nBut if Black takes now with 6... Bxc3, then 7. bxc3. Then Black has given up the bishop, but White has doubled pawns. However, White has the bishop pair and an open b-file. Alternatively, Black might not take and instead develop another piece.\n\n[...]\n\nSo, the best move here is likely 6... Bxc3, leading to 7. bxc3, and then Black continues with ...Nf6.\n\n\nDeepSeek-R1 thinks there is a knight on c3, whereas there is a pawn.\nThe reasoning is confusing, full of contradictions, and not in line with the concrete position.\nAt the end, 6…Bxc3 is proposed, but it is an illegal move: you cannot eat your own pown.\nI answered It's an illegal move and DeepSeek-R1 corrected itself with 6…Nf6.\nThe game continued as follows:\n1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 exd4 4. c3 dxc3 5. Bc4 Bb4 6. 0-0 Nf6 7. e5 Ne4 8. Qd5 Qe7 9. Qxe4 d5 10. Bxd5\nwith an already winning position for white.\nHere DeepSeek-R1 made an illegal move 10… Qxd5! and I answered It's an illegal move.\nThe answer was then 11... Qe6! with not the right move number. In any case, it gives a queen for free.\nOther games\nI have played a few other games with DeepSeek-R1.\nI won’t detail them as before, but report on the general behavior of DeepSeek-R1 in chess:\ngame #4: illegal moves after 9th move, clear advantage quickly in the game, give a queen for free. Very weak play.\ngame #5: originally, DeepSeek-R1 relies on ASCII board notation as part of the reasoning. It is perhaps a good idea, but it is not very well implemented. The model is not able to synthesize a correct chessboard, understand the rules of chess, and it is not able to play legal moves.\nDeepSeek-R1 vs weak Stockfish\nInstead of playing chess in the chat interface, I decided to leverage the API to create several games of DeepSeek-R1 against a weak Stockfish.\nBy weak, I mean a Stockfish with an estimated Elo rating between 1300 and 1900. Not the state-of-art Stockfish, but with a rating that is not too high.\nPrompt\nThe prompt is a bit tricky to instrument, since DeepSeek-R1 does not support structured outputs.\nAs of now, DeepSeek R1 does not natively support function calling or structured outputs.\nhttps://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1/issues/9#issuecomment-2604747754\nI used the following strategy as part of the system prompt:\n\nYou are a professional chess player.\nYou are playing a serious chess game, using PGN notation.\nWhen it's your turn, you have to play your move using PGN notation.\nFor your final decision, use <played_move>...</played_move> tags.\"\n\n\nOverall, I obtained 58 games.\nIllegal moves\nOut of 58 games against, 57 were games with one illegal move and only 1 was a legal game, hence 98 % of illegal games.\nIllegal moves are:\n \n      illegal_move\n    \nO-O\n      4\n    \nNxd4\n      3\n    \nNxe4\n      3\n    \nc3\n      3\n    \nBg5\n      2\n    \nQxc4\n      2\n    \nRxh5\n      2\n    \nO-O-O\n      2\n    \nd7+\n      1\n    \nQxd4\n      1\n    \nRae1\n      1\n    \nRxh4\n      1\n    \ndxc4\n      1\n    \nNf6\n      1\n    \nNxd5\n      1\n    \nBxg7\n      1\n    \nRd1\n      1\n    \nQh5+\n      1\n    \nNb5\n      1\n    \nQxg5\n      1\n    \nd5\n      1\n    \nbxc4\n      1\n    \nBd3\n      1\n    \nKxc1\n      1\n    \ndxe5\n      1\n    \nBc4\n      1\n    \nNxe5 dxe5 7. Qxd8+ Kxd8\n      1\n    \nRxe6\n      1\n    \nRxd5+\n      1\n    \nNxe2\n      1\n    \nNa4\n      1\n    \nNxd4 exd4\n      1\n    \nBxe6+\n      1\n    \nNxe5 dxe5\n      1\n    \nRxf4+\n      1\n    \nBd2\n      1\n    \ncxd5\n      1\n    \nfxe3\n      1\n    \nNxe5\n      1\n    \nexf7+\n      1\n    \nexd5\n      1\n    \nBxf7+\n      1\n    \nQxe3\n      1\n    \nBh6\n      1\n    \nThere is some diversity in the illegal moves, i.e., not a systematic error in the model.\nWhat is even more concerning is that the model quickly made illegal moves in the game.\nThe total number of plies played by deepseek-reasoner out of 58 games is 482.0.\nAround 12 % were illegal. More than 1 out of 10!\nThe longest game was only 20.0 moves (40 plies, 20 white moves, 20 black moves).\nThe average game length was 8.3 moves. The median game length was 8.0 moves.\n\nThe only legal game\nThe only legal game is as follows:\n\nThe level of play is very low, with a queen given for free, and a mate in 12 moves.\nLongest game\nThe longest game was 20 moves, and arguably a very bad game.\nOpening was OKish.\nThen each move is giving for no reason a piece. Something like 6 moves in a row giving a piece!\nAnd finally an illegal move.\nThe opponent was Stockfish estimated at 1490 Elo.\nIf I had to estimate Elo rating of DeepSeek-R1 it would be far less than 1490.\n\nAnalysis of the games\nIn general, the model is not able to play legal moves.\nThe explanations are not very accurate, and the reasoning is not very good.\nIt is hard to carefully read all explanations related to the 58 games and moves, but from the sample I have reviewed, the quality of the reasoning is not good, with long and confusing explanations.\nThere are also self contradictions. And clearly a lack of understanding of the rules of chess.\nWhen legal moves are played, the quality of moves is very low.\nDeepSeek-R1 is Worse than GPT-2 in Chess\nI have played with DeepSeek-R1 in chess, and I have to say that it is a very bad model for playing chess.\nIt is not able to play legal moves, and the quality of the reasoning (as found in the reasoning content/explanations) is very low.\nThe quality of the moves is very low as well.\nBack in 2020 I have reported on GPT-2.\nI have played with GPT-2 in chess, and I have the feeling that the specialized GPT-2 was better than DeepSeek-R1.\nIt can sound subjective, so before detailing the reasons, I will provide some evidence.\nIn 2020, I played a game https://lichess.org/VGsWKdY2 with 32 moves. Something not possible with DeepSeek-R1.\nAnother with 29 moves: https://lichess.org/25E56BCz#57\nThe ratio of illegal moves was much lower with GPT-2 than with DeepSeek-R1.\nBack to subjectivity, DeepSeek-R1 quickly made blunders and very weak moves. GPT-2 was a bit more consistent and played better moves.\nOverall, DeepSeek-R1 is worse than GPT-2 in chess: less capable of playing legal moves and less capable of playing good moves.\nIf it’s not “worse”, it is at least not better than GPT-2 in chess.\nDeepSeek-R1: Is it a regression?\nMore recently, I’ve rigorously assessed the ability of GPTs to play legal moves and to estimate their Elo rating.\nThe tldr; is that gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct is the best GPT model and is playing at 1750 Elo, a very interesting result (despite the generation of illegal moves in some games).\nThe ratio of illegal moves was much^much lower with gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct than with DeepSeek-R1.\nEven other GPT models like gpt-3.5-turbo or gpt-4 were better than DeepSeek-R1 in chess.\nSo, why DeepSeek-R1 supposed to excel in many tasks, is so bad in chess?\nAre we in a regression? Is it a bug? Is it a feature?\nI have some hypotheses.\nA first hypothesis is that I didn’t prompt DeepSeek-R1 correctly. It is possible.\nI have tried to include some PGN headers in the prompt (in the same vein as previous studies), but without tangible success. It is very unclear what is the right way to do it.\nFrankly, I don’t think it is the main reason. The model is simply not able to play legal moves, and it is not able to understand the rules of chess in a significant amount of cases.\nA second hypothesis is that the model is not trained on chess.\nObviously, the model knows something and in fact many things about chess, but it is not specifically trained on chess.\nThe chess “ability” has not magically “emerged” from the training process (as some people suggest).\nIn fact, looking at results of prior studies, including https://dynomight.net/chess/ https://dynomight.net/more-chess/, I don’t believe the chess ability has emerged from the architecture of the model.\nIt is more likely that the chess ability has been specifically trained on chess data, and/or that the model has been fine-tuned on chess data.\nFor instance, the GPT-4 pretraining dataset included chess games in the Portable Game Notation (PGN) format. Only games with players of Elo 1800 or higher were included in pretraining.\nIt can also be the case that the chat model is not as strong as a completion model, but I don’t think it is the main reason.\nHence, it is possible that DeepSeek-R1 has not been trained on chess data, and it is not able to play chess because of that.\nThere are two consequences.\nOn the one hand, it may mean that DeepSeek-R1 is not as general as some people claimed or hope to be.\nThe road to AGI is still long ;)\nIf you need data for every task, the definition of general is not the same.\nFrom my personal perspective, it would already be fantastic to reach this level of generalization, and we are not there yet (see next point).\nAs a side note, I found that chess is a difficult task to excel at without specific training and data.\nHumans, including top players, need lots of practice and training to become good at chess.\nInterestingly, the “truth” in chess can either be discovered (e.g., through extensive self-play), taught (e.g., through books, coaches, etc.), or extracted trough an external engine (e.g., Stockfish). There are thus different scenarios.\nOn the other hand, and as a follow-up of prior points, a very exciting research direction is to train DeepSeek-like models on chess data, in the same vein as documented in DeepSeek-R1, and to see how they can perform in chess.\nIt would be very interesting to see if DeepSeek-R1 can be fine-tuned on chess data, and how it would perform in chess.\nHow much data is needed to train DeepSeek-R1 on chess data is also a key question.\nDeepMind has recently shown that LLMs can be excellent at chess https://deepmind.google/research/publications/139455/ but with a specific architecture, innovations in the training process, and a lot of (synthetic) data.\nDeepSeek-R1 is seeking to be a more general model, and it is not clear if it can be efficiently fine-tuned.\nThe reasoning process of DeepSeek-R1 based on chain of thoughts is also to question.\nThe model is a “reasoner” model, and it tries to decompose/plan/reason about the problem in different steps before answering.\nIt is not clear if this process is suited to chess.\nConclusion\nI have played with DeepSeek-R1 in chess, and I have to say that it is a very bad model for playing chess.\nIt is not able to play legal moves in a vast majority of cases (more than 1 out of 10!), and the quality of the reasoning (as found in the reasoning content/explanations) is very low.\nThe quality of the moves is very low as well.\nIt is perhaps worse than GPT-2 in chess, a model released in 2020.\nI have some hypotheses on why DeepSeek-R1 is so bad in chess.\nIt is possible that the model has not been trained on chess data, and it is not able to play chess because of that.\nIt is also possible that the reasoning process of DeepSeek-R1 is not suited to domains like chess.\nDeepSeek-R1 already shows great promises in many tasks, and it is a very exciting model.\nHowever, the road to a general model capable of excelling in any domain is still long, and we are not there yet.\nEveryone is excited about the future of LLMs, and it is important to keep in mind that there are still many challenges to overcome.\nIt is an exciting time, and there are several research directions to explore.\nCode/data with games, reasoning, etc. on https://github.com/acherm/gptchess","summary":"I come to the conclusion that DeepSeek-R1 is worse than a 5 years-old version of GPT-2 in chess… The very recent, state-of-art, open-weights model DeepSeek R1 is breaking the 2025 news, excellent in many benchmarks, with a new integrated, end-to-end, reinforcement learning approach to large language model (LLM) training. I am personally very excited about this model, and I’ve been working on it in the last few days, confirming that DeepSeek R1 is on-par with GPT-o for several tasks. Yet, we are in 2025, and DeepSeek R1 is worse in chess than a specific version of GPT-2, released in… 2020. I will provide some evidence in this post, based on qualitative and quantitative analysis. I will discuss my hypotheses on why DeepSeek R1 may be terrible in chess, and what it means for the future of LLMs.","id":"http://blog.mathieuacher.com/DeepSeekR1WorstThanGPT2InChess%20copy","isoDate":"2025-01-22T09:54:29.000Z"},{"title":"How to Win in 4 or 7 Chess Moves against GPTs","link":"http://blog.mathieuacher.com/ChessWinning7MovesGPT-copy/","pubDate":"2024-05-15T09:54:29.000Z","author":"Mathieu Acher","content":"<p>I find a way to systematically force a win in 4 moves against the last release of OpenAI (ChatGPT-4o) and in 7 moves against the best GPT at chess <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct</code>, estimated at 1750 Elo. Clickbait: you don’t need to master chess to beat GPTs, you can well be 700 Elo, just follow the moves ;-) \nThe story behind the discovery is interesting and worth sharing. \nI also discuss the generalization of the results and the implications for the future of GPTs and chess. \nDon’t fear the clickbait, the post is serious!</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"gpts-and-chess\">GPTs and Chess</h2>\n\n<p>If you read this blog or follow me on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/acherm\">X/Twitter</a>, you know I have been interested in a while about generative AI technologies and chess. For instance, I have reported on <a href=\"https://blog.mathieuacher.com/GTP2AndChess/\">GPT-2</a> in 2020 and I’ve <a href=\"https://blog.mathieuacher.com/GPTsChessEloRatingLegalMoves/\">rigorously assessed the ability of GPTs to play legal moves and to estimate their Elo rating</a>. The tldr; is that <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct</code> is the best GPT model and is playing at 1750 Elo, a very interesting result (despite the generation of illegal moves in some games).</p>\n\n<p>I’ve got a lot of interactions with numerous people, including chess players, AI researchers, and data hobbyists. \nRecently, I’ve got new interests and ideas about GPTs and chess, and I’ve been working on new experiments and analysis.</p>\n\n<p>In particular, I’ve exchanged with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MonsieurPhi\">Monsieur Phi</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/YoshaIglesias\">Yosha Iglesias</a> about the impact of the prompt on the GPTs’ playing skill. \nMonsieur Phi made an awesome video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D1XIbkm4JE where I was interviewed. \nIt is based on my blog post and experiments, and it’s a great summary of the situation. It also opens new perspectives and ideas, including discussions about internal representation of GPTs. \nThere has been also suggestions about the impact of the prompt on the GPTs’ playing skill (X/Twitter thread in french: https://twitter.com/MonsieurPhi/status/1781260337754366265). \nYosha Iglesias has made a fantastic video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBx95bdJzh8 further exploring prompt sensitivity and surprising skills of GPT as well as many interesting ideas worth replicating in the large.\nThough the two videos are in French, they are very clear and insightful. Highly recommended!</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"gpt4o-and-the-discovery-of-a-4-moves-win-not-7-4\">GPT4o and the discovery of a 4 moves win (not 7, 4!)</h2>\n\n<p>The release of ChatGPT-4o a few hours ago encourages me to run new experiments. \nBasically to replicate the experiments I’ve done with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct</code> and to compare the results. \nI won’t publish in this post the results and analysis here (I will in a few days!) but let me quickly explain the process.</p>\n\n<p>The principle is to let GPTs play different games against Stockfish at different skill levels.\nTo do so, I use the OpenAI API, the Stockfish engine, and the following prompt:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>[Event \"FIDE World Championship Match 2024\"]\n[Site \"Los Angeles, USA\"]\n[Date \"2024.12.01\"]\n[Round \"5\"]\n[White \"Carlsen, Magnus\"]\n[Black \"Nepomniachtchi, Ian\"]\n[Result \"1-0\"]\n[WhiteElo \"2885\"]\n[WhiteTitle \"GM\"]\n[WhiteFideId \"1503014\"]\n[BlackElo \"2812\"]\n[BlackTitle \"GM\"]\n[BlackFideId \"4168119\"]\n[TimeControl \"40/7200:20/3600:900+30\"]\n[UTCDate \"2024.11.27\"]\n[UTCTime \"09:01:25\"]\n[Variant \"Standard\"]\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>as well as a system prompt <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">It is your turn! You have white pieces. Please complete the chess game using PGN notation.</code>.\nI’ve compiled around 200 games with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">gpt-4o</code> against Stockfish at different skills. \nI also used specific settings: temperature=0 and max_tokens=6. \nThese values are based <a href=\"https://blog.mathieuacher.com/GPTsChessEloRatingLegalMoves/\">on prior experiments</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve analyzed the games to assess the ability of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">gpt-4o</code> to play legal moves and to estimate its Elo rating, but again, I will publish the results in a few days.\nThroughout the analysis, <strong><em>I have incidentally noticed two games where <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">gpt-4o</code> were playing with black pieces and were losing in 4 moves</em></strong>!</p>\n\n<p>The game is as follows:\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">1. e4 d5 2. exd5 e5 3. dxe6 Qe7 4. exf7+</code></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"../assets/gpt4o-4moves-game.gif\" alt=\"4 moves win against gpt-4o\" /></p>\n\n<p>The game ends with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">4. exf7+</code>, since it is not a legal move: the pawn cannot move, since the king is checked by the Queen in e7. \nSo you win!</p>\n\n<p>Even a beginner won’t play <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">4. exf7+</code> in this position… because yeah, it’s not a legal move!</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"is-it-a-forced-win-in-4-moves\">Is it a forced win in 4 moves?</h2>\n\n<p>An immediate question is whether it is a forced win in 4 moves.\nThat is, is the sequence of moves played by GPTs is the same, from 1. e4 to 4. exd7+?\nYes!</p>\n\n<p>The temperature is 0, so it’s <em>supposed</em> to be deterministic.</p>\n\n<p>When asking to GPTs to play the same game, it plays the same moves.\nSpecifically, the first move of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">gpt-4o</code> is indeed 1. e4. \nWhen black plays 1…d5, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">gpt-4o</code> plays 2. exd5. \nWhen black plays 2…e5, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">gpt-4o</code> plays 3. dxe6. \nWhen black plays 3…Qe7, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">gpt-4o</code> plays 4. exf7+.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, under the same conditions, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">gpt-4o</code> plays the same moves!</p>\n\n<p>The full “end-user” session is here:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"../assets/GPT4oChessSession.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>In fact, two games were played exactly like this (as part of the experiments with Stockfish) and the moves were the same.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"winning-in-7-moves-against-gpt-35-turbo-instruct\">Winning in 7 moves against <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct</code></h2>\n\n<p>We can wonder whether the same sequence of moves is a forced win in 7 moves against <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct</code>.</p>\n\n<p>“Unfortunately”, it is not the case.\nWhen completing the game (same prompt!) <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct</code> responds: \n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">1. e4 d5 2. exd5 e5 3. dxe6 Qe7 4. Nf3</code></p>\n\n<p>Not a legal move, and the game is not over. Damn!\nIn fact, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct</code> is the best GPT model at chess, estimated at 1750 Elo, and it is not a big surprise that it plays a legal move!</p>\n\n<p>So now we have a challenge: how to win in <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">x</code> moves against <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct</code>?\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">x</code> being the smallest number of moves.\nAnd even better, how to win in a forced way?</p>\n\n<p>Hence, I’ve started exploring some possibilities.</p>\n\n<p>After <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">1. e4 d5 2. exd5 e5 3. dxe6 Qe7 4. Nf3</code> we can try a normal move like <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">Nc6</code> or <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">Nf6</code> but it doesn’t lead to a forced win.\nThe answer is typically <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">5. d4</code> and the game is not over.</p>\n\n<p>After numerous^numerous tries, I found an idea that works:</p>\n\n<p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">1. e4 d5 2. exd5 e5 3. dxe6 Qe7 4. Nf3 a5 5. d4 Ra6 6. Bxa6 Nd7 7. exd7+</code></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"../assets/gpt35-7moves-game.gif\" alt=\"7 moves win against gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct\" /></p>\n\n<p>The subtelties are in the moves a5 and Ra6, which are clearly “strange” moves, but it’s exactly what is needed to disturb a bit the GPT. \nIt also allows to force the white move Bxa6, which is nicer than having Be2 and then the queen in e7 is not threatening the king directly. \nIt should be noted that 6… Bd7 (same idea) is not working since white plays <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">0-0</code>! \nHence 6…Nd7 is really an exceptional move, though completely stupid in a normal game.</p>\n\n<p>The careful reader will notice that the second move above is <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">2... e5</code>. It is a variation of the 4 moves win, but it is working as well.\n2… e6 is also working! \nSo there are different variants of 7 moves win against <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct</code>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"robustness-to-prompt-variation\">Robustness to prompt variation</h2>\n\n<p>After <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">1. e4 d5 2. exd5 e5 3. dxe6 Qe7 4. Nf3 a5 5. d4 Ra6 6. Bxa6 Nd7 7.</code></p>\n\n<p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct</code> plays <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">7. exd7+</code> and the game is over.\nHowever, the prompt can be at the origin of the move <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">7. exd7+</code>.\nPerhaps “Carlsen, Magnus” as a white player (see PGN header above) is responsible!</p>\n\n<p>I have varied the original prompt with different white and black players, different Elos, different results, and different Elos.</p>\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n

Strictly speaking, when a chess player plays an illegal move, he or she loses the game. \n  It is the official rule of chess, see this article https://en.chessbase.com/post/illegal-moves-and-irregularities<br />\n  If you still disagree, then comes a next challenge: <strong>How to win as quickly as possible against GPTs without illegal moves from GPTs?</strong> Good luck!</li>\n  <li>What about white pieces? Can you win in 7 moves with white pieces? Unfortunately, I haven’t found a way to do so. It is a bit counter-intuitive, since having white pieces is an advantage in chess. But I think you get it we are not really interested by “normal” chess here. So it can be a disavantage to have white pieces in this specific setting.\n  Anyway, you have a new challenge: <strong>How to win as quickly as possible against GPTs with white pieces?</strong> Good luck!</li>\n  <li>The “no prompt” (ie no PGN header) is robust against the very specific sequence of moves leading to a quick win. There are two directions: assess the “no prompt” strategy in general, with regard to ability to play leval moves and Elo. My bet: it will weaken the model and hence you have more chances to win ;-) The second direction is to <strong><em>How to win as quickly as possible against GPTs when there is no PGN header in the prompt?</em></strong>. Good… luck!</li>\n  <li>I have used a GPT with temperature=0 and max_token=6, since it’s so far the best setting to play chess. But it is possible that another setting is better. So, <strong><em>How to win as quickly as possible against GPTs with another setting?</em></strong>. Very hard! A general strategy in which you can win against any GPT model with any setting would be a great achievement… But I suspect you would need to master a bit chess!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There are many open challenges.</p>\n\n<p>This experiment is, beyond chess, interesting. \nThe lesson is that GPT models are brittle, highly sensitive to a sequence of moves, prompts, etc. \nIt is not new at all, but an additional evidence.\nI made at least 3 connections with existing works.</p>\n\n<p>First is a work we conducted in 2022 on Codex and Copilot for code generation <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14699\">“Piloting Copilot and Codex: Hot Temperature, Cold Prompts, or Black Magic?”</a>. We varied the prompts and temperatures and show that the models are highly sensitive on Leetcode and HumanEval. On the one hand, it can deteriorate the performance of the model. On the other hand, it can be leveraged to have a better code generation. However, it is hardly possible to have a general effective strategy that would magically tune the prompt and temperature given a code task. An interesting perspective is that we modified the header of the prompt to include some famous (or not yet famous) Python developers (eg Guido van Rossum). It does have an impact, the same way white or black players specified in the prompt have an impact on the GPTs for chess!</p>\n\n<p>Second, there is a whole line of research on adversarial attacks on GPTs. The idea is to find a sequence of tokens that would make the model to generate a specific output (eg revealing industrial secrets, personal data). It is a bit different from the present work, since we are not looking for a specific output but for a specific sequence of moves leading to a win. But the idea is the same: the model is highly sensitive to the input. Perhaps it is not a big deal in chess. Yet, in general, illegal moves can reflect serious issues in many real-world applications (e.g., military) that people might envision with GPT technology. It’s freaking!</p>\n\n<p>Third, the “attack” is not general. It is specific to a model, a setting, a task. It is not a general attack on GPTs and the task of playing chess. \nFor instance, you can replicate my attempt and get very different results with another temperature (default is 1 on ChatGPT), max_token, and prompt (eg no prompt). \nAnd the trick of winning the game in <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">x</code> moves won’t work. Sorry in this case :( \nHowever, it might be the case the GPT you’re using has a high illegal move rate (eg much higher than with the settings I’ve used) and a weaker Elo rating. \nThen please thank me :)</p>\n\n<p>As I have shown in prior works https://blog.mathieuacher.com/GPTsChessEloRatingLegalMoves/, the way of prompting and the different variability factors are trickier to handle. \nWhat you gain here, you lose there. I have listed open challenges above, calling to further research about GPTs and chess, and more generally about GPTs and their robustness.</p>\n\n<p>Further reading: Monsieur Phi video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D1XIbkm4JE and Yosha Iglesias video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBx95bdJzh8 (two Youtube videos in french) are awesome!

Clickbait: you don’t need to master chess to beat GPTs, you can well be 700 Elo, just follow the moves ;-) \nThe story behind the discovery is interesting and worth sharing. \nI also discuss the generalization of the results and the implications for the future of GPTs and chess. \nDon’t fear the clickbait, the post is serious!\nGPTs and Chess\nIf you read this blog or follow me on X/Twitter, you know I have been interested in a while about generative AI technologies and chess. For instance, I have reported on GPT-2 in 2020 and I’ve rigorously assessed the ability of GPTs to play legal moves and to estimate their Elo rating. The tldr; is that gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct is the best GPT model and is playing at 1750 Elo, a very interesting result (despite the generation of illegal moves in some games).\nI’ve got a lot of interactions with numerous people, including chess players, AI researchers, and data hobbyists. \nRecently, I’ve got new interests and ideas about GPTs and chess, and I’ve been working on new experiments and analysis.\nIn particular, I’ve exchanged with Monsieur Phi and Yosha Iglesias about the impact of the prompt on the GPTs’ playing skill. \nMonsieur Phi made an awesome video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D1XIbkm4JE where I was interviewed. \nIt is based on my blog post and experiments, and it’s a great summary of the situation. It also opens new perspectives and ideas, including discussions about internal representation of GPTs. \nThere has been also suggestions about the impact of the prompt on the GPTs’ playing skill (X/Twitter thread in french: https://twitter.com/MonsieurPhi/status/1781260337754366265). \nYosha Iglesias has made a fantastic video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBx95bdJzh8 further exploring prompt sensitivity and surprising skills of GPT as well as many interesting ideas worth replicating in the large.\nThough the two videos are in French, they are very clear and insightful. Highly recommended!\nGPT4o and the discovery of a 4 moves win (not 7, 4!)\nThe release of ChatGPT-4o a few hours ago encourages me to run new experiments. \nBasically to replicate the experiments I’ve done with gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct and to compare the results. \nI won’t publish in this post the results and analysis here (I will in a few days!) but let me quickly explain the process.\nThe principle is to let GPTs play different games against Stockfish at different skill levels.\nTo do so, I use the OpenAI API, the Stockfish engine, and the following prompt:\n\n[Event \"FIDE World Championship Match 2024\"]\n[Site \"Los Angeles, USA\"]\n[Date \"2024.12.01\"]\n[Round \"5\"]\n[White \"Carlsen, Magnus\"]\n[Black \"Nepomniachtchi, Ian\"]\n[Result \"1-0\"]\n[WhiteElo \"2885\"]\n[WhiteTitle \"GM\"]\n[WhiteFideId \"1503014\"]\n[BlackElo \"2812\"]\n[BlackTitle \"GM\"]\n[BlackFideId \"4168119\"]\n[TimeControl \"40/7200:20/3600:900+30\"]\n[UTCDate \"2024.11.27\"]\n[UTCTime \"09:01:25\"]\n[Variant \"Standard\"]\n\n\nas well as a system prompt It is your turn! You have white pieces. Please complete the chess game using PGN notation..\nI’ve compiled around 200 games with gpt-4o against Stockfish at different skills. \nI also used specific settings: temperature=0 and max_tokens=6. \nThese values are based on prior experiments.\nI’ve analyzed the games to assess the ability of gpt-4o to play legal moves and to estimate its Elo rating, but again, I will publish the results in a few days.\nThroughout the analysis, I have incidentally noticed two games where gpt-4o were playing with black pieces and were losing in 4 moves!\nThe game is as follows:\n1. e4 d5 2. exd5 e5 3. dxe6 Qe7 4. exf7+\n\nThe game ends with 4. exf7+, since it is not a legal move: the pawn cannot move, since the king is checked by the Queen in e7. \nSo you win!\nEven a beginner won’t play 4. exf7+ in this position… because yeah, it’s not a legal move!\nIs it a forced win in 4 moves?\nAn immediate question is whether it is a forced win in 4 moves.\nThat is, is the sequence of moves played by GPTs is the same, from 1. e4 to 4. exd7+?\nYes!\nThe temperature is 0, so it’s supposed to be deterministic.\nWhen asking to GPTs to play the same game, it plays the same moves.\nSpecifically, the first move of gpt-4o is indeed 1. e4. \nWhen black plays 1…d5, gpt-4o plays 2. exd5. \nWhen black plays 2…e5, gpt-4o plays 3. dxe6. \nWhen black plays 3…Qe7, gpt-4o plays 4. exf7+.\nBasically, under the same conditions, gpt-4o plays the same moves!\nThe full “end-user” session is here:\n\nIn fact, two games were played exactly like this (as part of the experiments with Stockfish) and the moves were the same.\nWinning in 7 moves against gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct\nWe can wonder whether the same sequence of moves is a forced win in 7 moves against gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct.\n“Unfortunately”, it is not the case.\nWhen completing the game (same prompt!) gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct responds: \n1. e4 d5 2. exd5 e5 3. dxe6 Qe7 4. Nf3\nNot a legal move, and the game is not over. Damn!\nIn fact, gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct is the best GPT model at chess, estimated at 1750 Elo, and it is not a big surprise that it plays a legal move!\nSo now we have a challenge: how to win in x moves against gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct?\nx being the smallest number of moves.\nAnd even better, how to win in a forced way?\nHence, I’ve started exploring some possibilities.\nAfter 1. e4 d5 2. exd5 e5 3. dxe6 Qe7 4. Nf3 we can try a normal move like Nc6 or Nf6 but it doesn’t lead to a forced win.\nThe answer is typically 5. d4 and the game is not over.\nAfter numerous^numerous tries, I found an idea that works:\n1. e4 d5 2. exd5 e5 3. dxe6 Qe7 4. Nf3 a5 5. d4 Ra6 6. Bxa6 Nd7 7. exd7+\n\nThe subtelties are in the moves a5 and Ra6, which are clearly “strange” moves, but it’s exactly what is needed to disturb a bit the GPT. \nIt also allows to force the white move Bxa6, which is nicer than having Be2 and then the queen in e7 is not threatening the king directly. \nIt should be noted that 6… Bd7 (same idea) is not working since white plays 0-0! \nHence 6…Nd7 is really an exceptional move, though completely stupid in a normal game.\nThe careful reader will notice that the second move above is 2... e5. It is a variation of the 4 moves win, but it is working as well.\n2… e6 is also working! \nSo there are different variants of 7 moves win against gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct.\nRobustness to prompt variation\nAfter 1. e4 d5 2. exd5 e5 3. dxe6 Qe7 4. Nf3 a5 5. d4 Ra6 6. Bxa6 Nd7 7.\ngpt-3.5-turbo-instruct plays 7. exd7+ and the game is over.\nHowever, the prompt can be at the origin of the move 7. exd7+.\nPerhaps “Carlsen, Magnus” as a white player (see PGN header above) is responsible!\nI have varied the original prompt with different white and black players, different Elos, different results, and different Elos.\nResult\n      WhiteName\n      BlackName\n

Iglesias immediately reported that playing a game with the same settings (temperature, max_tokens, sequence of moves) but without any PGN header, the model played a legal move. Damn!\nI haven’t found a way to find a sequence of moves leading quick win in this setting.\nDoes it mean that “no prompt” is the best prompt?\nI highly doubt it. \nOn this specific position, OK, but in general, I don’t think so. \nPrior, informal experiments have shown that the PGN headers was helpful. \nAnd I can imagine why! \nAnyway, assessing the “no prompt” strategy for gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct is something to consider in the future. \nAnother replication of https://blog.mathieuacher.com/GPTsChessEloRatingLegalMoves/ is under way. Stay tuned!\nChallenges ahead!\nIt is possible to win against the last major GPT model of OpenAI gpt-4o in 4 moves, in a forced way. \nIt is possible to win against the best GPT model of OpenAI gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct for chess in 7 moves, in a forced way. \nThis model is rated 1750 Elo; human players rated 1750 Elo would not play such an illegal move.\nYou can well argue that:\nWinning because of an illegal move is not a real win. Strictly speaking, when a chess player plays an illegal move, he or she loses the game. \n  It is the official rule of chess, see this article https://en.chessbase.com/post/illegal-moves-and-irregularities\nHow to win as quickly as possible against GPTs without illegal moves from GPTs? Good luck!\nWhat about white pieces? Can you win in 7 moves with white pieces? Unfortunately, I haven’t found a way to do so. It is a bit counter-intuitive, since having white pieces is an advantage in chess. But I think you get it we are not really interested by “normal” chess here. So it can be a disavantage to have white pieces in this specific setting.\n  Anyway, you have a new challenge: How to win as quickly as possible against GPTs with white pieces? Good luck!\nThe “no prompt” (ie no PGN header) is robust against the very specific sequence of moves leading to a quick win. There are two directions: assess the “no prompt” strategy in general, with regard to ability to play leval moves and Elo. My bet: it will weaken the model and hence you have more chances to win ;-) The second direction is to How to win as quickly as possible against GPTs when there is no PGN header in the prompt?. Good… luck!\nI have used a GPT with temperature=0 and max_token=6, since it’s so far the best setting to play chess. But it is possible that another setting is better. So, How to win as quickly as possible against GPTs with another setting?. Very hard! A general strategy in which you can win against any GPT model with any setting would be a great achievement… But I suspect you would need to master a bit chess!\nThere are many open challenges.\nThis experiment is, beyond chess, interesting. \nThe lesson is that GPT models are brittle, highly sensitive to a sequence of moves, prompts, etc. \nIt is not new at all, but an additional evidence.\nI made at least 3 connections with existing works.\nFirst is a work we conducted in 2022 on Codex and Copilot for code generation “Piloting Copilot and Codex: Hot Temperature, Cold Prompts, or Black Magic?”. We varied the prompts and temperatures and show that the models are highly sensitive on Leetcode and HumanEval. On the one hand, it can deteriorate the performance of the model. On the other hand, it can be leveraged to have a better code generation. However, it is hardly possible to have a general effective strategy that would magically tune the prompt and temperature given a code task. An interesting perspective is that we modified the header of the prompt to include some famous (or not yet famous) Python developers (eg Guido van Rossum). It does have an impact, the same way white or black players specified in the prompt have an impact on the GPTs for chess!\nSecond, there is a whole line of research on adversarial attacks on GPTs. The idea is to find a sequence of tokens that would make the model to generate a specific output (eg revealing industrial secrets, personal data). It is a bit different from the present work, since we are not looking for a specific output but for a specific sequence of moves leading to a win. But the idea is the same: the model is highly sensitive to the input. Perhaps it is not a big deal in chess. Yet, in general, illegal moves can reflect serious issues in many real-world applications (e.g., military) that people might envision with GPT technology. It’s freaking!\nThird, the “attack” is not general. It is specific to a model, a setting, a task. It is not a general attack on GPTs and the task of playing chess. \nFor instance, you can replicate my attempt and get very different results with another temperature (default is 1 on ChatGPT), max_token, and prompt (eg no prompt). \nAnd the trick of winning the game in x moves won’t work. Sorry in this case :( \nHowever, it might be the case the GPT you’re using has a high illegal move rate (eg much higher than with the settings I’ve used) and a weaker Elo rating. \nThen please thank me :)\nAs I have shown in prior works https://blog.mathieuacher.com/GPTsChessEloRatingLegalMoves/, the way of prompting and the different variability factors are trickier to handle. \nWhat you gain here, you lose there. I have listed open challenges above, calling to further research about GPTs and chess, and more generally about GPTs and their robustness.\nFurther reading: Monsieur Phi video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D1XIbkm4JE and Yosha Iglesias video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBx95bdJzh8 (two Youtube videos in french) are awesome! Activate subtitles and enjoy :) \nAnd stay tuned for comprehensive experiments with gpt-4o (the last ChatGPT) and prompts sensitivity.","summary":"I find a way to systematically force a win in 4 moves against the last release of OpenAI (ChatGPT-4o) and in 7 moves against the best GPT at chess gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct, estimated at 1750 Elo. Clickbait: you don’t need to master chess to beat GPTs, you can well be 700 Elo, just follow the moves ;-) The story behind the discovery is interesting and worth sharing. I also discuss the generalization of the results and the implications for the future of GPTs and chess.

As in <a href=\"https://blog.mathieuacher.com/VaMoS2020/\">2020</a> (and actually as in 2007, 2008, …, 2023) a great conference about software variability, variants and configurations. \nHere is a small report and a few thoughts about the event, that (teasing!) will be organized in Rennes (France) in 2025.</p>\n\n<p>I started VaMoS with <a href=\"https://modevar.github.io/\">MODEVAR</a> workshop the day before, around 30 attendees. \nI gave a keynote “24 Reasons Why Variability Models Are Not Yet Universal” aka (24RWVMANYU). \nThe slides: https://github.com/acherm/24RWVMANYU-VaMoS-MODEVAR/blob/main/vamos2024.md (Markdown content) or in PDF on slideshare: https://www.slideshare.net/slideshows/24-reasons-why-variability-models-are-not-yet-universal-24rwvmanyu/266166318 are available online. \nVariability models (e.g., feature models) are widely used in software engineering practice and research, but there are some “silent” open problems or frustrations that I wanted to share. \nThe list is opinionated, incomplete, and was mainly here to foster some discussions. \nI used for the first time <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">reveal.js</code> to have the content in more readable and reusable format. Originally I wanted to generate the slides out of a specification of the list, and I found that Markdown could fit the purpose. It also forces me to not use many pictures or fancy diagrams. \nTo add fun to the fun, I’ve randomized the order of the 24 reasons (and slides). At some points, I click on a link of the slides, which has the effect of randomize again the slides. Ouch! \nAnyway, I had a lot of fun and there were many reactions, remarks, questions, etc. \nThe rest of the day was brainstorming about eg the UVL language https://github.com/Universal-Variability-Language/ an ongoing initiative to provide support for feature models. Web support, LSP, dataset sharing, APIs: It’s going into the right direction.\nThanks to Jessie Galasso and Chico Sundermann for the invitation, and the perfect organization of MODEVAR!</p>\n\n<p>Then VaMoS really started with an industrial keynote of Slawomir Duszynski, product line architect at Bosch.\nSome stunning numbers about complexity and variability: A motor control software at Bosch is ~120,000 variable components, ~10,000 long-living products, 300 interacting components with millions LOC in total, and 100+ feature models. \nWhen I started my PhD in 2008, having multiple feature models was not so obvious. But yes, variability is deep, spanning different layers and inter-connected systems. \nThe speaker challenged reverse engineering and extractive approaches of variability. I couldn’t agree more, it was on my list of 24 ;) and I’ve already written about eg in this blog https://blog.mathieuacher.com/VariantsAndLLM/.</p>\n\n<p>VaMoS continues with a bunch of presentations. I still argue that a key feature of VaMoS remains the discussant who must prepare slides to discuss the paper (summary of the understanding, applicability, future work, etc.) with the presenter. 15 minutes of presentation 15 minutes of discussions. You really get feedbacks! It is much better than some conferences where you traverse the Atlantic to have 1 out-of-the-scope, unprepared question.</p>\n\n<p>Among presentations, I really enjoyed a fascinating talk by Paul Grünbacher about variants and versions of… music artefacts.

As in 2020 (and actually as in 2007, 2008, …, 2023) a great conference about software variability, variants and configurations. \nHere is a small report and a few thoughts about the event, that (teasing!) will be organized in Rennes (France) in 2025.\nI started VaMoS with MODEVAR workshop the day before, around 30 attendees. \nI gave a keynote “24 Reasons Why Variability Models Are Not Yet Universal” aka (24RWVMANYU). \nThe slides: https://github.com/acherm/24RWVMANYU-VaMoS-MODEVAR/blob/main/vamos2024.md (Markdown content) or in PDF on slideshare: https://www.slideshare.net/slideshows/24-reasons-why-variability-models-are-not-yet-universal-24rwvmanyu/266166318 are available online. \nVariability models (e.g., feature models) are widely used in software engineering practice and research, but there are some “silent” open problems or frustrations that I wanted to share. \nThe list is opinionated, incomplete, and was mainly here to foster some discussions. \nI used for the first time reveal.js to have the content in more readable and reusable format. Originally I wanted to generate the slides out of a specification of the list, and I found that Markdown could fit the purpose. It also forces me to not use many pictures or fancy diagrams. \nTo add fun to the fun, I’ve randomized the order of the 24 reasons (and slides). At some points, I click on a link of the slides, which has the effect of randomize again the slides. Ouch! \nAnyway, I had a lot of fun and there were many reactions, remarks, questions, etc. \nThe rest of the day was brainstorming about eg the UVL language https://github.com/Universal-Variability-Language/ an ongoing initiative to provide support for feature models. Web support, LSP, dataset sharing, APIs: It’s going into the right direction.\nThanks to Jessie Galasso and Chico Sundermann for the invitation, and the perfect organization of MODEVAR!\nThen VaMoS really started with an industrial keynote of Slawomir Duszynski, product line architect at Bosch.\nSome stunning numbers about complexity and variability: A motor control software at Bosch is ~120,000 variable components, ~10,000 long-living products, 300 interacting components with millions LOC in total, and 100+ feature models. \nWhen I started my PhD in 2008, having multiple feature models was not so obvious. But yes, variability is deep, spanning different layers and inter-connected systems. \nThe speaker challenged reverse engineering and extractive approaches of variability. I couldn’t agree more, it was on my list of 24 ;) and I’ve already written about eg in this blog https://blog.mathieuacher.com/VariantsAndLLM/.\nVaMoS continues with a bunch of presentations. I still argue that a key feature of VaMoS remains the discussant who must prepare slides to discuss the paper (summary of the understanding, applicability, future work, etc.) with the presenter. 15 minutes of presentation 15 minutes of discussions. You really get feedbacks! It is much better than some conferences where you traverse the Atlantic to have 1 out-of-the-scope, unprepared question.\nAmong presentations, I really enjoyed a fascinating talk by Paul Grünbacher about variants and versions of… music artefacts. I loved the connection with other areas, the role of software, the DSLs, and the power of varying code in space and time.

Basically, engineering external, textual DSLs at the speed of light! \nLangium is the successor of <a href=\"https://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/\">Xtext</a> and is under active development. \nLangium targets TypeScript, Language Server Protocol (LSP), VSCode, and Web technologies.\nOne “feature” I am missing from Xtext is the ability to programmatically test your DSL: test your syntax and

teaching and research, and I enjoyed facilities to test DSL (see eg https://blog.mathieuacher.com/XtextStandaloneParsing/).\nXtext was oriented towards Java, Eclipse, and EMF as opposed to Langium that targets TypeScript, VSCode, and Web technologies. \nI was seeking a solution for testing DSLs in Langium and I found a solution that I want to share.</p>\n\n<p>We first need a helper function that loads any program written in your DSL and returns the AST. \nIn TypeScript and leveraging the Langium API:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-typescript highlighter-rouge\"><div

Bc4 Qh4+ 4. Kf1 b5 5. Bxb5 Nf6\");\n        (async () => {\n            const pgn_moves_with_python = await convertMovesToPGNWithPython(game.moves);\n            expect(pgn_moves).toBe(pgn_moves_with_python);\n        })();\n    });\n\n\nI tested an interpreter based on chess.js that translates a chess game into PGN format. \nI also tested another translation into PGN, this time generating and executing Python code (based on python-chess).\nMore details here: https://github.com/acherm/dsl-langium/blob/main/Chess/src/generator/pgn_converter.ts and https://github.com/acherm/dsl-langium/blob/main/Chess/src/test/pgn-test.ts\nOther technicalities\nTo make it work, you have to set up a few things in your project:\nadding a vite.config.ts to set up vite testing framework (eg see https://github.com/acherm/dsl-langium/blob/main/Chess/vite.config.ts)\nin the package.json adding a script rule \"test\": \"vitest\" and devDependencies something like \"vitest\": \"^0.27.3\",, in such a way you can use npm run test (eg see https://github.com/acherm/dsl-langium/blob/main/Chess/package.json)\nConclusion\nI have shown how to test your DSLs in Langium, leveraging the Langium API and the vitest testing framework.\nFor sure, other testing frameworks can be used as well.\nThe solution I have presented, quite closed to ParseHelper in Xtext, can be systematized to any DSL. \nI hope new versions of Langium will generate such testing facilities out of the box.\nGithub of the illustrative project: https://github.com/acherm/dsl-langium/tree/main/Chess. \nSee also DSLs in Langium here: https://github.com/acherm/dsl-langium/.\nPost also available on dev.to: https://dev.to/diverse_research/testing-your-dsls-in-langium-gp9","summary":"Langium is a framework to build domain-specific languages (DSLs).

Web browsers like Firefox or Chrome are available on different operating systems, in different languages, while users can configure 2000+ preferences or install numerous 3rd parties extensions (or plugins). Web servers like Apache, operating systems like the Linux kernel, or a video encoder like x264 are other examples of software systems that are highly configurable at compile-time or at run-time for delivering the expected functionality andmeeting the various desires of users.\nVariability (“the ability of a software system or artifact to be efficiently extended, changed, customized or configured for use in a particular context”) is therefore a crucial property of software systems. Organizations capable of mastering variability can deliver high-quality variants (or products) in a short amount of time and thus attract numerous customers, new use-cases or usage contexts. A hard problem for end-users or software developers is to master the combinatorial explosion induced by variability: Hundreds of configuration options can be combined, each potentially with distinct functionality and effects on execution time, memory footprint, quality of the result, etc. The first part of this course will introduce variability-intensive systems, their applications and challenges, in various software contexts.

Web browsers like Firefox or Chrome are available on different operating systems, in different languages, while users can configure 2000+ preferences or install numerous 3rd parties extensions (or plugins). Web servers like Apache, operating systems like the Linux kernel, or a video encoder like x264 are other examples of software systems that are highly configurable at compile-time or at run-time for delivering the expected functionality andmeeting the various desires of users.\nVariability (“the ability of a software system or artifact to be efficiently extended, changed, customized or configured for use in a particular context”) is therefore a crucial property of software systems. Organizations capable of mastering variability can deliver high-quality variants (or products) in a short amount of time and thus attract numerous customers, new use-cases or usage contexts. A hard problem for end-users or software developers is to master the combinatorial explosion induced by variability: Hundreds of configuration options can be combined, each potentially with distinct functionality and effects on execution time, memory footprint, quality of the result, etc. The first part of this course will introduce variability-intensive systems, their applications and challenges, in various software contexts. We will use intuitive examples (like a generator of LaTeX paper variants) and real-world systems (like the Linux kernel).\nA second objective of this course is to show the relevance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques for exploring and taming such enormous variability spaces. In particular, we will introduce how (1) satisfiability and constraint programming solvers can be used to properly model and reason about variability; (2) how machine learning can be used to discover constraints and predict the variability behavior of configurable systems or software product lines.","summary":"Mathieu Acher gave a course at EJCP (summer school for PhD students in computer science) about “Software Variability and Artificial Intelligence”.

# PhD Position "Uncertainty Management in Software Product Lines" in collaboration with Airbus 

## Topic
A software product line is a set of software-intensive systems that share a common, managed set of features satisfying the specific needs of a particular market segment or mission and that are developed from a common set of core assets in a prescribed way. Variability management is a core concern in software product lines, making it possible to select the right set of features to answer a well defined need. 
However when everything is not fully known, deciding wich is the optimal solution can be rather difficult. 
Engineers typically deal with these uncertainties by first trying to reduce them as much as possible, and then most often just ignoring them (unless they work in safety critical domains).  Recognising the presence of uncertainties can contribute to reducing their influence and increasing the level of trust in a given project. Researchers have thus started to focus on identification and modelling of uncertainties, and recognised that not all uncertainty can be traced to its origin, eliminated or accounted for.  The goal of this PhD thesis is to explore how uncertainty could be more explicitly addressed and systematically managed in the modeling of software product lines, in order to guide the process of product derivation.  

The PhD candidate will (1) design novel variability modelling languages capable of supporting the expressiveness of uncertainties; (2) develop automated reasoning techniques (e.g., based on statistical learning) capable of communicating insights about uncertainties; (3) propose theories and foundations for engineering variability-intensive and uncertainty-aware systems; (4) empirically assess the proposed solutions in industrial contexts and possibly on open-source projets. 

This PhD will take place in the context of the OneWay project led by **Airbus France** to redefine the future of commercial aircraft development.

This branch hosts the team web pages

WARNING: Work in progress!!

Based on {hugo}.

== To add content

Students::

- Go to the `content/students` folder and add a `.md+` file for each of your students.
- Add also a `[[team.students]]` item in the `content/team.md` file

NOTE: This is temporary, DRY principle should be applied everywhere soon ;-)

Pictures::

- upload your picture in the `static/img/team/` folder (default pix is `portrait.jpg`)

Other content (project, publication, talk)::

- Go to the `content/xxx` folder (e.g., `content/talk`)
- Follow the existing naming rule (if any) to create a new entry file (e.g., `20180119-CERFACS.md`),
by copying an existing one to get the attributes to fill
